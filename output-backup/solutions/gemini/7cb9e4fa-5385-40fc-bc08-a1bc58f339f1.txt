To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given 15 points, we need to find the shortest cycle visiting all points exactly once.

**1. Analysis of Point Locations:**
*   **Left Cluster:** Points 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14.
    *   2, 7, 10 are at the bottom left.
    *   11, 3, 1 are in the middle left.
    *   14, 5, 6 are at the top left.
*   **Center Bridge:** Point 4 is situated between the left and right groups.
*   **Right Cluster:** Points 8, 9, 12, 13, 15.
    *   9, 12 are at the top right.
    *   8, 13, 15 are at the bottom right.

**2. Path Construction Strategy:**
The points form a general "C" or loop shape, but with a significant gap in the middle. Point 4 acts as a crucial bridge.
*   **Right Side:** The points 9, 12, 8, 15, 13 form a natural chain along the right edge. The sequence 9-12-8-15-13 moves from top-right to bottom-right.
*   **Bridge to Left:** Point 13 (bottom right) is closest to point 4 (center), and point 4 is closest to point 2 (bottom left). This creates an efficient bottom bridge: 13 -> 4 -> 2.
*   **Left Side:** Starting from 2, we sweep through the left cluster.
    *   From 2, the path goes to the nearby corner group: 7 and 10. The order 2 -> 7 -> 10 minimizes distance.
    *   From 10, move up to 11.
    *   From 11, move right to 3.
    *   From 3, move to 1.
    *   From 1, move up to 14.
    *   From 14, move to the top group 5 and then 6.
*   **Closing the Loop:** From point 6 (top left), we must jump back to the start of the right chain (point 9) to complete the cycle. While this is a long jump, it is the necessary "gap crossing" to close the loop after using point 4 as the lower bridge.

**3. Final Path Sequence:**
*   Start at **1**.
*   Go up-left to **14**.
*   Up to **5**, then right to **6**.
*   Long jump across the top to **9**.
*   Right to **12**, then down to **8**.
*   Down to **15**, left to **13**.
*   Up-left to the center point **4**.
*   Down-left to **2**.
*   Left to **7**, then **10**.
*   Up to **11**, right to **3**, and back to **1**.

**Visit Order:**
1 -> 14 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 8 -> 15 -> 13 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 3 -> (1)

1, 14, 5, 6, 9, 12, 8, 15, 13, 4, 2, 7, 10, 11, 3
