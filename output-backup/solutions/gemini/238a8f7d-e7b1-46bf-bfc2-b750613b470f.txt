To find the shortest tour for the 10 points shown in the image, we analyze the spatial clusters and potential paths to form a loop that minimizes total distance and avoids crossing lines.

1.  **Analyze Clusters:**
    *   **Top-Left/Center:** Point **6** is in the far top-left corner. Point **1** is near the top center. Point **3** is on the left side.
    *   **Bottom-Left:** Point **10** is isolated in the bottom-left corner.
    *   **Top-Right:** A cluster comprising points **8, 4, 2, 7**. Point **4** is the furthest top-right. Point **8** is to its left. Point **2** is below 8. Point **7** is below 2.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** Points **9** and **5**. Point **9** is the furthest bottom-right. Point **5** is to its left.

2.  **Determine Local Paths:**
    *   **Corner Logic (Point 6):** Point 6 is an extreme corner. Its only reasonable neighbors to connect to are **1** and **3**. Thus, the sequence segment `... -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> ...` (or reverse) is effectively mandatory.
    *   **Corner Logic (Point 10):** Point 10 is another extreme corner. Its nearest neighbors are **3** and **5**. Connecting to anyone else (like 6 or 9) would involve very long diagonal lines. Thus, the sequence `... -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> ...` is required.
    *   **Right Side Sweep:** From **5**, the nearest neighbor is **9**. From **9**, the path naturally flows up to **7**. So, `... -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> ...`.
    *   **Top-Right Cluster (8, 4, 2, 7):** We are entering this cluster from **1** (closest to 8) and leaving from **7** (connected to 9). The points to visit are 8, 4, 2. The most efficient path that avoids crossing lines is to go from 8 to the outer point 4, then tuck back in to 2, and then out to 7. Path: `1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7`.
        *   Alternative `1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7` creates a "V" shape that likely results in longer total distance or crossings.
        *   The path `1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7` creates a smooth "C" like curve.

3.  **Construct the Full Loop:**
    Combining the segments in a clockwise direction starting from 1:
    *   Start at **1**.
    *   Go right to **8**.
    *   Go right to **4**.
    *   Go down-left to **2**.
    *   Go down-right to **7**.
    *   Go down to **9**.
    *   Go left to **5**.
    *   Go down-left to **10**.
    *   Go up-right to **3**.
    *   Go up-left to **6**.
    *   Return to **1**.

    **Sequence:** 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7 -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6
