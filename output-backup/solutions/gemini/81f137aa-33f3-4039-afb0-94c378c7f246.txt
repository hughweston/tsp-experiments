Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour is constructed by visiting the points in a loop that minimizes the total distance (Travel Salesman Problem).

1.  **Left Cluster:** The points 4, 1, 10, 6, and 8 form a vertical line on the left. The optimal path down this line is **4 → 1 → 10 → 6 → 8**. Point 8 is the leftmost point at the bottom of this cluster.
2.  **Transition to Bottom:** From point 8, the nearest neighbor to the right is point **5** in the lower-middle section.
3.  **Bottom-Right Cluster:** From point 5, the tour proceeds to the bottom-right corner. The points here are 2 and 7. Point 2 is the furthest out (corner), and 7 is slightly inward and above it. To visit 2 efficiently, the path should go **5 → 2**, then hook back to **7**.
4.  **Transition to Top:** From point 7, the path goes up to the top-right cluster. The next point is **3**.
5.  **Top Cluster:** From point 3, the path moves left to point **9**.
6.  **Closing the Loop:** From point 9, the path returns to the start at point **4**.

The full sequence tracing the perimeter counter-clockwise (starting from 1 for the final output):
1 → 10 → 6 → 8 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 4 → (back to 1).
