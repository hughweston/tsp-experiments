To find the shortest tour visiting all 15 points, we can analyze the clusters and their connectivity based on the image geometry.

1.  **Identify Clusters:**
    *   **Top Left:** Point 8 is isolated.
    *   **Mid-Left Cluster:** Points 10, 3, 12, 15. (10 is top-left, 3 is top-right, 15 is bottom-left, 12 is bottom-right).
    *   **Bottom-Left/Middle:** Points 13, 1, 4.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** Points 7, 11, 6.
    *   **Mid/Top-Right Cluster:** Points 14, 2, 9, 5.

2.  **Determine Path Segments:**
    *   **Starting at 8:** The nearest neighbors are in the Mid-Left cluster. The path from 8 to 10 is the most direct entry.
    *   **Mid-Left (10, 3, 12, 15):** The optimal traversal of these four points forming a rough rectangle, entering at 10 and aiming to exit towards the bottom, is **10 -> 3 -> 12 -> 15**. This avoids diagonals and uses the short edges. From 15, the path naturally leads to 13.
    *   **Bottom (13, 1, 4):** These points form a line. The sequence is naturally **13 -> 1 -> 4**.
    *   **Bottom-Right (7, 11, 6):** From 4, the nearest point is 7. The triangle formed by 7, 11, and 6 is best traversed as **7 -> 11 -> 6**, which leaves us at 6, pointing upwards towards 14.
    *   **Mid/Top-Right (14, 5, 2, 9):** Entering from 6, the next closest point is 14. We must visit 14, 5, 2, and 9. Point 5 is an outlier to the far right. Point 2 and 9 are close together near the top. To minimize distance, we should go from 14 out to 5, then back to 2, and finally to 9. The sequence **14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9** is shorter than visiting 2 before 5 because 2 is very close to the exit point 9, so visiting it last minimizes the final step.
    *   **Closing the Loop:** From 9, there is a clear long connection back to 8 to close the cycle.

3.  **Construct the Full Path:**
    Combining the segments: 8 -> 10 -> 3 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 11 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9 -> (back to 8).

    Rotating the list to start at point 1:
    1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 11 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9 -> 8 -> 10 -> 3 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13

1, 4, 7, 11, 6, 14, 5, 2, 9, 8, 10, 3, 12, 15, 13
