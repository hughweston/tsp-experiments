Based on the visual analysis of the points' positions, here is the step-by-step derivation of the shortest tour:

1.  **Identify Clusters and Chains:**
    *   **Left Cluster:** Points 2, 5, and 6 form a natural chain on the left side. Order: $2 - 5 - 6$.
    *   **Right Cluster:** Points 9, 8, 1, and 10 form a vertical chain on the right side. Order: $9 - 8 - 1 - 10$.
    *   **Middle Points:** Points 3, 4, and 7 are in the middle.

2.  **Determine Connections:**
    *   The "Right Chain" ($9-8-1-10$) needs to be entered at one end and exited at the other to minimize backtracking. The endpoints are **9** (top) and **10** (bottom).
    *   The "Left Chain" ($2-5-6$) naturally connects to **7** at the bottom ($6-7$) and needs a connection at the top (**2**).
    *   **Middle Connections:**
        *   Point **4** is very close to point **3**. They should likely be visited consecutively.
        *   Point **4** is the best bridge to the top-right (**9**) or top-left (**2**).
        *   Point **3** is located between the upper group (4, 9) and lower group (7, 10).
    
3.  **Constructing the Loop (Convex Hull & Insertions):**
    *   **Outer Loop:** A hull-following path would connect the outer points: $2 \to 4 \to 9 \to 8 \to 1 \to 10 \to 7 \to 6 \to 5 \to 2$.
    *   **Inserting Point 3:** Point 3 is internal. We must insert it into the loop where it adds the least distance.
        *   *Option A:* Insert between 7 and 10? The distance $7-10$ is long, but $7-3-10$ is significantly longer.
        *   *Option B:* Insert between 4 and 9? The distance $4-9$ is a straight horizontal line. Point 3 is "tucked" just underneath this line. The path $4 \to 3 \to 9$ adds relatively little distance compared to the straight $4 \to 9$ edge (roughly 11 units of "detour" cost vs 14+ for the bottom insertion).
    *   Therefore, the optimal sequence passes through the middle top: $... \to 2 \to 4 \to 3 \to 9 \to ...$

4.  **Final Path Assembly:**
    *   Start at **1**.
    *   Go up the right side: **1 $\to$ 8 $\to$ 9**.
    *   Cross to the middle/left via 3 and 4: **9 $\to$ 3 $\to$ 4**.
    *   Go to the top-left: **4 $\to$ 2**.
    *   Go down the left side: **2 $\to$ 5 $\to$ 6**.
    *   Go to the bottom-middle: **6 $\to$ 7**.
    *   Return to the bottom-right: **7 $\to$ 10**.
    *   Close the loop: **10 $\to$ 1**.

**Tour Sequence:** 1, 8, 9, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10
