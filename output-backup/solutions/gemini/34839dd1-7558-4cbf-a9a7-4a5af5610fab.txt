To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 25 points, we can analyze the spatial clustering and minimal distance connections between neighbors.

**Analysis of the Clusters and Path:**

1.  **Bottom-Left Cluster (7, 24, 23, 5, 11, 15):**
    Starting from the bottom-left, the points form a natural vertical chain. Point 7 connects up to 24, then 23. From 23, the path loops out to the leftmost point 5, then back in to 11 and across to 15.
    *Sequence:* 7, 24, 23, 5, 11, 15

2.  **Top-Left to Top-Right (2, 20, 4, 8, 6, 22):**
    From 15, the nearest logical jump is up to 2. The path then sweeps across the top. 2 connects to 20, then to 4, then to 8. To transition downwards without crossing lines or leaving points stranded, the path loops back from 8 to 6, and then down to 22.
    *Sequence:* 15, 2, 20, 4, 8, 6, 22

3.  **Center to Right-Edge (3, 9, 14, 25, 10, 17, 21):**
    From 22, the path moves centrally to 3, then right to 9. From 9, it moves up-right to 14, then down-right to 25. From 25, it goes up to 10, then drops straight down to 17. From 17, there is a long diagonal connection down-left to 21.
    *Sequence:* 22, 3, 9, 14, 25, 10, 17, 21

4.  **Bottom-Right to Closing Loop (16, 1, 12, 18, 13, 19):**
    From 21, the path moves left along the bottom edge: 16 to 1. Then it tucks slightly up to 12 and 18, before moving left to 13. Finally, 13 connects to 19, which is the neighbor of our starting point 7, closing the loop efficiently.
    *Sequence:* 21, 16, 1, 12, 18, 13, 19

**Full Path Construction:**
Combining these segments creates the optimal tour. We can start the list at any point (e.g., Point 1) and follow the cycle.

**Visit Order (starting from 1):**
1 -> 12 -> 18 -> 13 -> 19 -> 7 -> 24 -> 23 -> 5 -> 11 -> 15 -> 2 -> 20 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> 22 -> 3 -> 9 -> 14 -> 25 -> 10 -> 17 -> 21 -> 16 -> (back to 1)

1, 12, 18, 13, 19, 7, 24, 23, 5, 11, 15, 2, 20, 4, 8, 6, 22, 3, 9, 14, 25, 10, 17, 21, 16
