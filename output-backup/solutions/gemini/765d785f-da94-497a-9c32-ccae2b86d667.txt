To find the shortest path for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with these 15 points, we need to construct a tour that visits every point exactly once and returns to the start, minimizing the total distance. Visually, this often involves following the "convex hull" (the outer boundary) and efficiently weaving into the internal points.

Here is the step-by-step logical construction of the shortest tour:

1.  **Start at Point 4 (Top Left):** This point is an outlier at the top left. The tour naturally connects to its nearest neighbors to the right and below.
2.  **Move to Point 1:** From 4, the path goes East to Point 1, the other top outlier.
3.  **Descend the Right Side (1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11):** From 1, the most logical step is down to Point 9. Continuing down the outer edge, we visit Point 7 (bottom-right corner), then move left along the bottom edge to the nearby Point 10, and then to Point 11.
4.  **Weave Inwards (11 -> 2 -> 8):** From 11, moving directly left is a large jump. It's more efficient to move up slightly to Point 2, then left to the central Point 8. This covers the internal points on the right side efficiently.
5.  **Cross to the Left Cluster (8 -> 13):** From the central Point 8, we need to enter the cluster of points on the bottom-left. The best entry point that allows for a smooth path is Point 13.
6.  **Traverse the Bottom-Left (13 -> 15 -> 12):** From 13, we move West along the bottom row to Point 15, and then to the corner Point 12.
7.  **Zig-Zag Upwards (12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6):** From the bottom-left corner (12), we move up to Point 5. To efficiently cover the remaining points, we move right to Point 14, and continue right to Point 6.
8.  **Return to Start (6 -> 3 -> 4):** From Point 6, we move directly up to Point 3. Point 3 is the closest neighbor to our starting Point 4, closing the loop perfectly.

**The Loop:** 4 -> 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6 -> 3 -> (back to 4)

Starting the list at 1 (as is common convention):

1, 9, 7, 10, 11, 2, 8, 13, 15, 12, 5, 14, 6, 3, 4
