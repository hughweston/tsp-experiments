Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once is a cycle that generally follows the perimeter of the point cloud, handling local clusters efficiently.

Here is the step-by-step derivation of the path:
1.  **Right Cluster**: Starting at point **1** (top right), the path moves down to the cluster at the bottom right. The most efficient order is **1** $\rightarrow$ **7** $\rightarrow$ **2** $\rightarrow$ **15**.
2.  **Bottom Connection**: From the bottom-right corner (**15**), the tour must cross to the left. The nearest point to bridge this gap is **8** (bottom center).
3.  **Bottom-Left Cluster**: From **8**, the tour continues to the bottom-left corner. The most efficient sequence to visit the "dead end" at **14** is to go **8** $\rightarrow$ **14**, then move up to **9** and **6**.
4.  **Left Side Ascent**: From **6**, the tour moves inward and up to **12**, then **13**.
5.  **Top Cluster**: From **13**, the path goes to the top points. The optimal order is **5** $\rightarrow$ **3** $\rightarrow$ **4** (moving left to right).
6.  **Closing the Loop**: From **4**, the path descends slightly to the remaining points near the start. It visits **11**, then **10**, which connects efficiently back to **1**.

**Coordinates Check (Visual Approximation):**
*   (Top chain): 13 $\rightarrow$ 5 $\rightarrow$ 3 $\rightarrow$ 4
*   (Right descent): 4 $\rightarrow$ 11 $\rightarrow$ 10 $\rightarrow$ 1
*   (Right leg): 1 $\rightarrow$ 7 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 15
*   (Bottom leg): 15 $\rightarrow$ 8 $\rightarrow$ 14
*   (Left ascent): 14 $\rightarrow$ 9 $\rightarrow$ 6 $\rightarrow$ 12 $\rightarrow$ 13

Final Order:
1, 7, 2, 15, 8, 14, 9, 6, 12, 13, 5, 3, 4, 11, 10
