To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given 30 points, I have estimated the coordinates and distances between points to find the shortest possible cycle. The path connects local clusters while minimizing the length of the "bridges" between them.

The logical tour proceeds as follows:
1.  **Top Right:** Start at point **1**, move to **4**, then connect to the center cluster via **22**.
2.  **Top Left:** From **22**, jump to **8**, then loop through the top-left corner: **26**, **23**, down to **6** and **7**.
3.  **Far Left:** From **7**, go to **25**, then **30**, and jump down to the bottom-left corner at **27**.
4.  **Bottom Left:** Traverse the bottom edge: **29**, **24**, **10**, **16**.
5.  **Center Return:** Move inward from **16** to **20**, then **5**, and down to **12**.
6.  **Bottom Right:** continue along the bottom: **3**, **14**, **18**, **15**, **19**.
7.  **Right Side:** Move up the right edge: **9**, **11**, **17**, **13**, **2**, **21**, **28**.
8.  **Close Loop:** From **28**, return to **1**.
