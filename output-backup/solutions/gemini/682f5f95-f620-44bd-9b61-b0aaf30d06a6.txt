To find the shortest tour for the given 20 points, we can analyze the clusters and their connectivity to form a logical cycle.

**Analysis of Clusters:**
1.  **Left/Start:** Point 10 is the leftmost point. Points 3, 11, 14 form a bottom-left chain. Points 1, 8, 6 form a top-left chain.
2.  **Top:** Point 9 bridges the top-left and the center.
3.  **Top-Middle:** Points 12, 16, 18 form a triangle cluster. 12 is close to 9. 18 is the rightmost of this group, suitable for bridging to the right.
4.  **Right:** A large cluster containing 5, 13, 4, 19, 2, 20.
    *   Point 5 is at the top, closest to 18.
    *   Point 2 is at the bottom right.
    *   Point 20 is on the inner (left) side of this cluster, closest to the center points.
5.  **Center-Vertical:** Points 17, 15, 7 form a vertical line in the middle gap.
    *   17 is top, close to 20.
    *   7 is bottom, close to 14.

**Route Construction:**
We will trace a path that minimizes crossing and backtrack, likely following a general clockwise or counter-clockwise loop with indentations for the inner points.

1.  **Start at 10 (Mid-Left):**
    *   Go Up: `10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 6`. This covers the left edge efficiently.
    *   Cross Top: `6 -> 9`.
2.  **Top-Middle Cluster:**
    *   From 9, the nearest point is 12.
    *   From 12, go to 16.
    *   From 16, go to 18. (Sequence `9 -> 12 -> 16 -> 18` traverses this group and ends at 18, positioned to jump right).
3.  **Right Cluster (Outer Sweep):**
    *   Jump from 18 to 5 (Top of right cluster).
    *   Descend the outer edge: `5 -> 13 -> 4`.
    *   Continue down to 19 and 2. Point 19 is between 4 and 2. To avoid a dead-end at 2, we visit them in line: `4 -> 19 -> 2`.
4.  **Right Cluster (Inner Return):**
    *   From 2 (bottom right), we need to return towards the center. The only unvisited point in this cluster is 20.
    *   Path: `2 -> 20`. This is a long diagonal, but necessary to exit the cluster towards the middle. *Correction*: It's better to verify if 19 is better placed. Geometrically, `4 -> 19 -> 2 -> 20` avoids "hooking" back. The point 20 is the exit gate to the center.
5.  **Center-Vertical Spine:**
    *   From 20, the closest point is 17.
    *   Go down the spine: `17 -> 15 -> 7`.
6.  **Bottom-Left Return:**
    *   From 7, connect to the bottom chain starting at 14.
    *   Path: `7 -> 14`.
    *   Complete the loop: `14 -> 11 -> 3 -> 10`.

**Final Sequence Check:**
1, 8, 6, 9, 12, 16, 18, 5, 13, 4, 19, 2, 20, 17, 15, 7, 14, 11, 3, 10.
(This forms a complete cycle `10 -> 1` to close it).

1, 8, 6, 9, 12, 16, 18, 5, 13, 4, 19, 2, 20, 17, 15, 7, 14, 11, 3, 10
