To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 20 points, we analyze the spatial distribution and clustering of the points to form a logical cycle.

**Analysis of Clusters and Path:**
1.  **Top-Left Cluster (17, 6, 10, 20):** These points form a clear group. The path naturally flows `17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 20` (or reverse).
2.  **Connection to Center (20 -> 5 -> 19):** Point 20 is closest to point 5. Point 5 acts as a bridge to the central point 19. So, `20 -> 5 -> 19`.
3.  **Center to Top-Right (19 -> 16 -> 18):** From 19, the path moves right to 16. From 16, the most efficient way to catch the isolated top-right corner is `16 -> 18`.
4.  **Right Side Descent (18 -> 1 -> 9 -> 13):** From the corner 18, the path must sweep down the right edge. Point 1 is slightly "inside" the line between 18 and 9, making `18 -> 1 -> 9` the optimal sequence (minimal detour compared to skipping 1). Then `9 -> 13`.
5.  **Bottom Sweep (13 -> 11 -> 4):** Continuing along the bottom edge/perimeter moving left: `13 -> 11 -> 4`.
6.  **Bottom-Center to Bottom-Left (4 -> 14 -> 12 -> 3 -> 15):** From 4, we move slightly up/left to 14, then continue the leftward sweep through 12, 3, and down to 15.
7.  **Bottom-Left Corner (15 -> 7 -> 8 -> 2):** Completing the bottom-left cluster: `15 -> 7 -> 8 -> 2`.
8.  **Closing the Loop (2 -> 17):** Point 2 is the end of the bottom-left chain. The loop is closed by connecting 2 back to the start point 17. Although this is a longer jump, it is necessary to connect the two ends of the "C" shape formed by the other short connections.

**Final Path Sequence:**
Start at 17, go down/right through the center, up to the top right, down the right side, across the bottom, and up the left side back to 17.

17, 6, 10, 20, 5, 19, 16, 18, 1, 9, 13, 11, 4, 14, 12, 3, 15, 7, 8, 2
