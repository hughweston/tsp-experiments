To find the shortest tour for the 25 points shown in the image, I have analyzed the spatial distribution and clustering of the points. Here is the step-by-step logical route construction:

1.  **Left Side & Start:** Starting at point **1** (lower-left-center), the route goes down to the corner at **24**, then to the far left point **9**.
2.  **Left Upward Sweep:** From **9**, moving upwards along the left edge visits **6**, then cuts inward to **2**, and up to **15**.
3.  **Top Left Cluster:** From **15**, the path jumps to the top-left group, visiting **17**, then **8**, **5**, and **20**.
4.  **Top Bridge:** **20** connects across the top gap to **12**, the isolated top-center point.
5.  **Right Side Descent:** From **12**, the path goes to **19** and **21**, then zig-zags inward to **10** and down to **4**.
6.  **Bottom Right Loop:** From **4**, the route enters the dense bottom-right cluster. It sweeps across the top of this group: **16** -> **3** -> **23** -> **7**. Then it turns the corner at **13** and sweeps back along the bottom: **14** -> **11** -> **22**.
7.  **Bottom Center Return:** From **22**, the path connects to the bottom-center point **25**, then up to **18**.
8.  **Closing the Loop:** Finally, **18** is the closest neighbor to the starting point **1**, completing the cycle.

1, 24, 9, 6, 2, 15, 17, 8, 5, 20, 12, 19, 21, 10, 4, 16, 3, 23, 7, 13, 14, 11, 22, 25, 18
