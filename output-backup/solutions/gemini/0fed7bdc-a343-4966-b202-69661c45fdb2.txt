Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest Traveling Salesman tour follows the perimeter of the set of points, making indentations to visit the inner points (4 and 13) at the most efficient locations.

Here is the step-by-step construction of the path:
1.  **Bottom-Right to Right:** Start at **1** (bottom-right). Move up to the inner point **13** (mid-right), then out to **5** (far-right).
    *   Segment: 1 -> 13 -> 5
2.  **Right to Top:** From 5, move up to **2** (top-right corner), then left to **3**, and further left to **15** (top-center).
    *   Segment: 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 15
3.  **Top to Left:** From 15, continue left to **7**, then to the top-left corner **12**, and down to **11** (mid-left).
    *   Segment: 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 11
4.  **Left to Bottom:** From 11, move down to **10** (bottom-left corner), then right to **14**.
    *   Segment: 11 -> 10 -> 14
5.  **Bottom Section (incorporating point 4):** From 14, go to **9**. The central point **4** is located just above the gap between 9 and 6. The most efficient detour is to visit **4** after 9 and before 6. So, go 9 -> 4 -> 6. Then continue right to **8**.
    *   Segment: 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8
6.  **Closing the Loop:** From 8, return to the starting point **1**.

**Full Tour:**
1 -> 13 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 11 -> 10 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> (back to 1)

1, 13, 5, 2, 3, 15, 7, 12, 11, 10, 14, 9, 4, 6, 8
