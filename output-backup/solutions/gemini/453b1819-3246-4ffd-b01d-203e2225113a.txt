Based on the visual positions of the points, I have constructed a tour that minimizes the total distance by following a logical path through the clusters (perimeter scan with internal weaving).

Here is the step-by-step logic for the path:
1.  **Bottom-Left Start:** Begin at **1** (bottom-left) and move to **11** (corner), then up to **7**.
2.  **Left Inner Cluster:** From 7, move inwards to **25**, then **19**, **12**, **5**, and **9** to cover the central group efficiently.
3.  **Left Edge:** Move from 9 to **20**, then up to **16** and **21**.
4.  **Top Edge:** traverse the top from left to right: **23**, **15**, **14**, then over to **3** and **17** (top-right corner).
5.  **Right Side Down:** Move down to **13**, then **18**. Cut inward slightly to visit **4**, then back out to **24** and down to **6**.
6.  **Bottom Right:** Finish the right edge at **10**, then **2**, and **8**.
7.  **Return:** From 8, move left to **22**, which connects back to start point 1.

The final optimized tour order is:

1, 11, 7, 25, 19, 12, 5, 9, 20, 16, 21, 23, 15, 14, 3, 17, 13, 18, 4, 24, 6, 10, 2, 8, 22
