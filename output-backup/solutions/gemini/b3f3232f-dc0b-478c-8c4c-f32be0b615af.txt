To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given 25 points, I will trace the shortest path by identifying clusters and connecting nearest neighbors to form a single continuous loop.

1.  **Left Cluster (Top-Down):** Starting at **15** (top left), the nearest point is **14**, followed by **25**. From 25, the path goes down to the bottom-left point **6**, then slightly up and right to **16**.
    *Path:* 15, 14, 25, 6, 16

2.  **Bottom-Center Cluster:** From 16, the closest point to the right is **12**. From 12, we navigate the vertical stack of points: up to **2**, down to **24**, then to **8**. The logical exit from this cluster to the right is **13**.
    *Path:* ..., 12, 2, 24, 8, 13

3.  **Bottom-Right Cluster:** From 13, the nearest neighbor is **23**, then down to **11**. From 11, we go to the lowest point **17**, then up to **20**.
    *Path:* ..., 13, 23, 11, 17, 20

4.  **Right Cluster (Ascending):** From 20, we move up to **1**. Continuing upwards, the path goes to **9**, then **5**, then **7**, and finally to the top-right corner **21**.
    *Path:* ..., 20, 1, 9, 5, 7, 21

5.  **Top Cluster (Right-to-Left):** From 21, we move left to **3**, then **19**. From 19, we drop slightly to **18**, then **22**, then **10**. Finally, **4** acts as the bridge back to the starting area (point 15).
    *Path:* ..., 21, 3, 19, 18, 22, 10, 4

6.  **Closing the Loop:** Point 4 connects back to 15, completing the cycle.

**Final Path List:**
15, 14, 25, 6, 16, 12, 2, 24, 8, 13, 23, 11, 17, 20, 1, 9, 5, 7, 21, 3, 19, 18, 22, 10, 4
