To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with the given 10 points, we can determine the optimal path by following the perimeter of the points, effectively tracing the "convex hull" and visiting intermediate points in their logical geometric order. This minimizes travel distance by avoiding crossing paths and backtracking.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1.  **Identify Point Locations:**
    *   **Top Cluster:** Point **8** is top-left. Point **9** is immediately to its right. Point **7** is to the right of 9. Point **2** is the highest point, located to the right of 7.
    *   **Right Side:** Point **4** is below and right of 2. Point **10** is below 4 on the right edge.
    *   **Bottom Side:** Point **6** is at the bottom-right corner. Point **1** is to the left of 6 along the bottom. Point **5** is the bottom-left corner.
    *   **Left Side:** Point **3** is midway up the left side, connecting 5 back to 8.

2.  **Trace the Optimal Path (Clockwise):**
    *   Start at the top-left with **8**.
    *   Move right to the nearest neighbor **9**.
    *   Continue right to **7**.
    *   Go up to the peak point **2**.
    *   Descend right to **4**.
    *   Continue down to **10**.
    *   Go to the bottom-right corner **6**.
    *   Move left along the bottom to **1**.
    *   Continue left to the corner **5**.
    *   Move up the left side to **3**.
    *   Finally, return to **8** to close the loop.

3.  **Construct the Sequence:**
    The sequence of points following this path is: 8, 9, 7, 2, 4, 10, 6, 1, 5, 3.
    
    Starting from point **1** for the output list (as implied by numerical order, though any start is valid):
    Go from 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> (back to 1).

**Final Path:**
1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6

1, 5, 3, 8, 9, 7, 2, 4, 10, 6
