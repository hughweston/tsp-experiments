To find the shortest tour for the 20 points shown in the image, we can analyze the clusters and nearest neighbors to construct a logical path.

1.  **Identify Clusters and Extremities:**
    *   **Bottom Left:** Points 12, 20, 10.
    *   **Left Edge:** Points 16, 18, 6.
    *   **Top Left:** Point 2 (isolated).
    *   **Center/Top:** Points 8, 19, 9.
    *   **Right Cluster:** Points 4, 14, 17, 13, 11, 15, 1, 3, 5, 7.

2.  **Constructing the Path Segments:**
    *   **Start at Bottom Left:** Start at **12**. The nearest neighbor is **20**. From 20, proceed up the left side to **16** and **18**.
    *   **Left Side Ascent:** From 18, go to **6**, then up to the isolated point **2**.
    *   **Crossing to Center:** From 2, the best connection to the rest of the graph is **8** (the gap to 19 or 9 is larger).
    *   **Top Section:** From 8, go to **19**, then to the top-rightmost point **9**.
    *   **Right Cluster Descent:**
        *   From 9, go down to **4**.
        *   From 4, weave through the right cluster efficiently: **13** is nearby, then **17**, then up slightly to **14** (to cover the corner), then down the far right edge to **11** and **15**.
    *   **Bottom Return:**
        *   From 15, sweep left along the bottom: **1**, then **3**.
        *   From 3, move inward to **5**, then to **7**.
        *   Finally, from 7, close the loop to **10**, which connects back to the start area (12).

3.  **Final Path Verification:**
    *   Sequence: 12 -> 20 -> 16 -> 18 -> 6 -> 2 -> 8 -> 19 -> 9 -> 4 -> 13 -> 17 -> 14 -> 11 -> 15 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 10.
    *   This path visits all 20 points exactly once and minimizes long jumps by following the natural clusters and outer hull where appropriate.
