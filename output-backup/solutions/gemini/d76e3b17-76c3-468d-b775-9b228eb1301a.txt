To find the shortest tour visiting all 15 points, we need to trace a path that connects neighboring points efficiently without crossing itself or making unnecessarily long jumps.

1.  **Analyze the Point Clusters:**
    *   **Top Left:** Points 8, 15, 4, 14.
    *   **Bottom Left:** Points 6, 3, 5.
    *   **Top Right:** Points 11, 1, 9, 7.
    *   **Mid/Bottom Right:** Points 13, 2, 10, 12.

2.  **Determine Local Connections:**
    *   In the **Top Left**, the sequence **8 → 15 → 4 → 14** (or reverse) is most efficient due to short distances.
    *   In the **Bottom Left**, **5 → 3 → 6** is the logical chain. 6 connects well to 4 vertically.
    *   In the **Top/Mid Right**, **9** connects well to **11** and **1**? No, **9 → 11 → 1** is a strong triangle. From **1**, the closest point towards the center is **7**. **7** connects to **13**. **13** is very close to **2**.
    *   In the **Bottom Right**, **10** and **12** form a pair. **2** connects reasonably to **10**.

3.  **Identify Bridges (Long Jumps):**
    *   We need to connect the Left and Right sides.
    *   **Top Bridge:** Point **14** (Left) is horizontally aligned with Point **9** (Right). This is a good crossing point.
    *   **Bottom Bridge:** Point **12** (Right) is the closest feasible point to jump to Point **5** (Left) to close the loop (though it's a long segment, it's unavoidable).

4.  **Construct the Path:**
    *   Start at **14** (Top Left inner).
    *   Cross to **9** (Top Right inner).
    *   Visit the Top Right corner: **9 → 11 → 1**.
    *   Move down the Right side: From **1**, go to **7**, then **13**, then **2**.
    *   Continue to Bottom Right: **2 → 10 → 12**.
    *   Cross to Bottom Left: **12 → 5**.
    *   Move up the Left side: **5 → 3 → 6**.
    *   Connect to Top Left: **6 → 4 → 15 → 8**.
    *   Close the loop: **8 → 14**.

5.  **Refine and Order:**
    *   Let's trace this cycle: 14, 9, 11, 1, 7, 13, 2, 10, 12, 5, 3, 6, 4, 15, 8.
    *   Let's check the start point. The example output starts with 1. Since it's a cycle, we can rotate the list to start at 1.
    *   Sequence: **1 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 10 → 12 → 5 → 3 → 6 → 4 → 15 → 8 → 14 → 9 → 11**.
    *   (And 11 loops back to 1).

6.  **Final Verification:**
    *   **1 → 7**: Short diagonal.
    *   **7 → 13**: Short vertical.
    *   **13 → 2**: Very short horizontal.
    *   **2 → 10**: Medium diagonal.
    *   **10 → 12**: Medium diagonal.
    *   **12 → 5**: Long jump (necessary).
    *   **5 → 3**: Medium vertical.
    *   **3 → 6**: Short diagonal.
    *   **6 → 4**: Long vertical (best option on left).
    *   **4 → 15**: Medium diagonal.
    *   **15 → 8**: Short vertical.
    *   **8 → 14**: Medium diagonal.
    *   **14 → 9**: Horizontal bridge.
    *   **9 → 11**: Medium diagonal.
    *   **11 → 1**: Medium vertical.

This path covers all points efficiently with minimal total distance.
