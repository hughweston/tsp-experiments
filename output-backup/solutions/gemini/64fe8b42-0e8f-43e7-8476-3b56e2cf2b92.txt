Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour follows a path that navigates the clusters and minimizes long jumps between distinct regions.

The points can be grouped into approximate clusters:
- **Top Right:** 1, 9, 16, 25 (and 11, 3 nearby)
- **Top Left:** 22, 6, 19, 23
- **Left/Bottom Left:** 13, 24, 15
- **Bottom Center:** 5, 4, 20, 10, 14
- **Center:** 18, 17, 8
- **Right/Bottom Right:** 21, 12, 7, 2

The optimized route sweeps through these clusters in a large loop:
1.  Start at **1** (top right), go to **25** and **3**.
2.  Move down the center to **11**, then **8**, **17**, and **18**.
3.  Move up to the top left cluster via **19**, **6**, **22**.
4.  Drop down the left edge: **23**, **13**, **24**, **15**.
5.  Traverse the bottom from left to right: **14**, **5**, **4**, **20**, **10**.
6.  Move up the right side: **21**, **12**, **7**, **2**.
7.  Complete the loop at the top right: **9**, **16** (which connects back to 1).
