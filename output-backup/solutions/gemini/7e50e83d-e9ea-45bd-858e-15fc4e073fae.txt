Based on the visual analysis of the point locations and estimating the Euclidean distances between them, here is the step-by-step derivation of the shortest tour:

1.  **Start at Point 1** (bottom-left). The nearest point is **Point 8**.
2.  **From Point 8**, the path naturally continues to the right to **Point 5**, which is the closest neighbor and continues the loop's direction.
3.  **From Point 5**, the tour turns upwards to **Point 7**, which is the nearest unvisited point.
4.  **From Point 7**, **Point 2** is very close, making it the obvious next step.
5.  **From Point 2**, we must visit the top-right corner. The loop extends to **Point 6**. Note that while Point 4 is geometrically close to Point 2, visiting 6 between 2 and 4 (or after) is necessary. The most efficient sub-tour locally is 2 -> 6 -> 4 because Point 6 is otherwise isolated and Point 2 is closer to 6 than 7 or 3 is.
6.  **From Point 6**, go to **Point 4** (top-middle).
7.  **From Point 4**, traverse left to **Point 3**.
8.  **From Point 3**, continue left to the isolated **Point 10**.
9.  **From Point 10**, move down to **Point 9**.
10. **From Point 9**, close the loop back to **Point 1** (this is the long return edge, but necessary to complete the cycle).

The resulting path forms a simple polygon without self-intersections, verifying its likely optimality.
