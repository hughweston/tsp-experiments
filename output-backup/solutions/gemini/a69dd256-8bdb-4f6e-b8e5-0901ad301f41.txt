To find the shortest Traveling Salesman tour, we can group the points into clusters and trace the most logical path that minimizes distances between points and clusters.

1.  **Analyze Clusters and Geometry:**
    *   **Top-Left:** Points 15, 6, 1, 10, 19.
    *   **Bottom-Left:** Points 5, 4, 20, 8, 3, 13, 14.
    *   **Right/Bottom-Right:** Points 16, 9, 11, 17, 12, 2, 18, 7.

2.  **Trace the Path (Starting from Point 1 for standard output):**
    *   **Start at 1:** The closest neighbor is **10**.
    *   **From 10:** The logical continuation is down to **19**.
    *   **From 19:** We need to jump to the bottom-left cluster. The closest point is **5** (or via 3, but 5 is an endpoint of a chain). Entering at 5 allows traversing the cluster efficiently.
    *   **Bottom-Left Chain:** From **5**, the nearest is **4**. Then **20**, then **8**.
    *   **The "Loop" in Bottom-Left:** From **8**, we have points 3, 13, and 14 remaining. Point 3 is higher, 13 is right, 14 is lower. To exit towards the right side (point 16), we should end at 14. The most efficient sub-path is **8 -> 3 -> 13 -> 14**. (Going 8->13->3->14 is longer because the jump 3->14 is large).
    *   **The Bridge:** From **14**, make the long jump across the gap to **16**.
    *   **Right Side Line:** From **16**, follow the line rightward: **9**, then **11**, then to the far end **17**.
    *   **Turning Back:** From **17**, loop back up/left to **12**.
    *   **Top-Right Cluster:** From **12**, go up to **2**. From 2, the path loops inward to **18** and **7**. Comparing `2->7->18->15` vs `2->18->7->15`: The path `2->18->7->15` is geometrically smoother (avoids a zigzag) and slightly shorter. So, **2 -> 18 -> 7**.
    *   **Closing the Loop:** From **7**, go to **15** (top center). Then down to **6**, which connects back to **1**.

**Final Path Sequence:**
1 -> 10 -> 19 -> 5 -> 4 -> 20 -> 8 -> 3 -> 13 -> 14 -> 16 -> 9 -> 11 -> 17 -> 12 -> 2 -> 18 -> 7 -> 15 -> 6

1, 10, 19, 5, 4, 20, 8, 3, 13, 14, 16, 9, 11, 17, 12, 2, 18, 7, 15, 6
