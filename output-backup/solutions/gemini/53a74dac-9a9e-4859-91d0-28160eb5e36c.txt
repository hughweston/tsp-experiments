To find the shortest tour for the 25 points shown in the image, we follow a path that connects nearest neighbors while forming a coherent loop (roughly following the convex hull and weaving into internal points where efficient).

Here is the step-by-step logic for the constructed tour:
1.  **Top-Left Cluster:** Start at **1** (approx 28,75). Move left to **23** (22,78), then to the far left **15** (5,85), then down to **24** (18,70).
2.  **Middle-Left:** From 24, drop down to **6** (25,55) and then **7** (35,56).
3.  **Middle/Bottom-Left:** From 7, move to **4** (45,34), then left to **19** (34,34) and **11** (30,35).
4.  **Bottom-Left Corner:** From 11, jump to the far bottom-left **10** (5,30). Then move right to **13** (15,20) and **20** (20,22).
5.  **Bottom Edge:** From 20, go down/right to **3** (20,5), then **5** (35,10), then **2** (58,5).
6.  **Bottom-Right:** From 2, move up to **17** (68,28) and then further right to **22** (92,50).
7.  **Right Edge:** From 22, move inwards to **14** (75,65), then to **8** (82,68), and up to the corner **12** (95,92).
8.  **Top-Right:** From 12, go left to **18** (78,95), then **16** (65,85), and up to the top peak **25** (55,95).
9.  **Closing the Loop:** From 25, go down to **9** (48,70), then left to **21** (32,73). Finally, 21 connects back to our starting point 1 (distance is very short).

This path covers all 25 points efficiently with minimal crossing and total distance.
