To find the shortest Traveling Salesman tour, we can analyze the positions of the points to form a logical loop that minimizes the total distance. The general strategy is to follow the "convex hull" (the outer boundary) of the set of points and insert the inner points into the tour where they cause the least additional distance (detour).

**1. Coordinate Estimation & Grouping:**
*   **Far Left:** 9, 1
*   **Top:** 4, 10, 7
*   **Right:** 6, 2
*   **Bottom:** 3, 8, 5

**2. Path Construction:**

*   **Left Side:** Points 9 and 1 are isolated on the left. Point 1 sits almost directly on the line between 5 and 9. Point 9 is the furthest out. Connecting **5 → 1 → 9** is very efficient (almost a straight line). From 9, the tour must close the loop, and the most logical connection is up to 4. So, the sequence is **5 → 1 → 9 → 4**.
*   **Top Side:** From 4, the nearest neighbor is 10. Point 7 is the top-right corner. Point 6 is "inside" the triangle formed by 10, 7, and 2. The distance from 10 to 6 is short, and 6 to 7 is short. Going **10 → 6 → 7** creates a small "V" detour which is much shorter than skipping 6 or visiting it from 2. So, the sequence is **4 → 10 → 6 → 7**.
*   **Right Side:** From 7 (top right), the path must go down to 2 (bottom right). This is a long edge, but necessary to close the right side. Sequence: **7 → 2**.
*   **Bottom Side:** From 2, we move left. Point 3 is the natural next step. Point 8 lies between 3 and 5, slightly inwards. Inserting 8 between 3 and 5 (i.e., **3 → 8 → 5**) adds very little distance compared to the direct 3 → 5 line. So, the sequence is **2 → 3 → 8 → 5**.

**3. Assembling the Tour:**
Combining the segments:
... **5 → 1 → 9 → 4 → 10 → 6 → 7 → 2 → 3 → 8 → 5** ...

Let's check the loop starting from 1 for the final output:
1.  **1**
2.  **9** (Leftmost turn)
3.  **4** (Long diagonal up)
4.  **10** (Top middle)
5.  **6** (Inner point, efficiently visited here)
6.  **7** (Top right corner)
7.  **2** (Bottom right corner)
8.  **3** (Bottom edge)
9.  **8** (Inner bottom point)
10. **5** (Bottom left, returns to 1)

This path visits all points exactly once and minimizes crossing and long jumps.
