To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with the given 25 points, I have analyzed the spatial distribution and relative distances of the points.

The optimal route follows the perimeter of the point set while efficiently weaving into the center to cover internal points without creating long crossings.

**Analysis of the route:**
1.  **Top Cluster:** Starting at **1**, move right to **21**, then to the top-right corner points **10** and **11**.
2.  **Right Side:** Descend from **11** to **7**, then to the outer right edge **18**, down to **6** and **16**.
3.  **Bottom Right:** Curve inwards from **16** to **20**, then sweep up to the inner point **13** and **4** to cover the right-central area.
4.  **Center:** From **4**, move left into the center to **14**, then **9**, and drop down to **17**.
5.  **Bottom Left:** From **17**, sweep along the bottom edge leftwards to **23**, **19**, and **3**.
6.  **Left Side:** Move up the left edge to **15** and **8**.
7.  **Inner Left:** From **8**, weave inwards to **5**, then up to **25** and **12**, which are vertically aligned.
8.  **Top Left Return:** From **12**, move left to **22** (on the edge), up to the corner **2**, and finally to **24** which connects back to the start point **1**.

**Final Route:**
1, 21, 10, 11, 7, 18, 6, 16, 20, 13, 4, 14, 9, 17, 23, 19, 3, 15, 8, 5, 25, 12, 22, 2, 24
