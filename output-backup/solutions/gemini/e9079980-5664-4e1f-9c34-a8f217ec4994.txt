To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 20 points, we analyze the spatial clusters and relative distances between points.

1.  **Identify Clusters:**
    *   **Top-Left:** Points 18, 19.
    *   **Left/Center:** Points 1, 4, 5, 6, 9.
    *   **Bottom-Left:** Points 7, 8, 13.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** Points 11, 20.
    *   **Lower-Right Cluster:** Points 12, 3, 15.
    *   **Far-Right:** Points 2, 17.
    *   **Upper-Right:** Points 14, 10, 16.

2.  **Determine Path Segments:**
    *   **Start at Point 1:** The closest neighbors are 4 and 18. Point 18 is quite far up, while 4 is closer to the right. We will initiate the path 1 → 4 to sweep the center first.
    *   **Center Sweep (1, 4, 6, 5, 9):** From 1, go to 4. From 4, point 5 is very close, but 6 is slightly further out. A logical sweep that avoids crossing lines and sets up the next segment is 1 → 4 → 6 → 5 → 9. This moves from top-center down to the middle.
    *   **Connector to Bottom-Left (9, 7, 8, 13):** From 9, the best connection to the bottom-left cluster is 7. Then follow the natural line 7 → 8 → 13 along the bottom edge.
    *   **Bottom Bridge (13, 11, 20):** From 13, there is a gap to the right. The best connection is to 11. From 11, continue along the bottom edge to 20.
    *   **Lower-Right Loop (20, 12, 3, 15, 17, 2):** From 20, move up to 12. Then loop through the tight cluster: 12 → 3 → 15. From 15, jump to the far right point 17, then up to 2.
    *   **Upper-Right Return (2, 14, 10, 16, 19, 18):** From 2, move left to the vertical column of points. 14 is the closest entry. Then move up: 14 → 10 → 16. From 16, make the long jump back across the top to 19, then to 18.
    *   **Closing the Loop (18, 1):** Finally, 18 connects back to 1 to complete the cycle.

3.  **Construct Final List:**
    Combining these segments in order:
    1 → 4 → 6 → 5 → 9 → 7 → 8 → 13 → 11 → 20 → 12 → 3 → 15 → 17 → 2 → 14 → 10 → 16 → 19 → 18

1, 4, 6, 5, 9, 7, 8, 13, 11, 20, 12, 3, 15, 17, 2, 14, 10, 16, 19, 18
