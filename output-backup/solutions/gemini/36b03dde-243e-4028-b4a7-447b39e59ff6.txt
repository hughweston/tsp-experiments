To find the shortest tour visiting all 10 points exactly once, we need to trace the path that minimizes the total travel distance. By observing the spatial distribution of the points, we can determine the optimal sequence by following the perimeter (convex hull) and efficiently including the internal points.

**Visual Analysis & Path Construction:**

1.  **Top Cluster (1, 3, 2, 7):** These points form the upper edge. Visually, moving from **7** (top left) to **1**, then **3**, then **2** (top right) creates a smooth arc.
2.  **Right Side (2, 9, 10):** From point **2**, the nearest logical next step is downwards. Point **9** is located centrally but towards the right. Point **10** is further right and down.
    *   Directly connecting 2 to 10 is a long jump.
    *   Visiting **9** on the way from **2** to **10** (or vice versa) is efficient. The sequence **2 -> 9 -> 10** (or 10-9-2) makes geometric sense.
3.  **Bottom Right (10, 5):** From **10**, point **5** is the closest neighbor downwards.
4.  **Bottom Edge (5, 4, 6):** From **5**, moving left, we hit **4**, and then further left into the corner is **6**. The sequence **5 -> 4 -> 6** follows the bottom edge perfectly.
5.  **Left Edge (6, 8, 7):** From **6**, moving up the left side, we encounter **8**, which then connects back to our starting area at **7**.

**Connecting the Loop:**

Let's verify the full cycle:
*   Start at **1**.
*   Go left to **7**, then down to **8**, then down to **6**. (Path: 1-7-8-6)
*   Go right across the bottom: **6** to **4** to **5**. (Path: 6-4-5)
*   Go up the right side: **5** to **10**. (Path: 5-10)
*   Now we need to close back to the top right. We have point **9** and point **2** left.
*   Go from **10** inwards to **9**, then up to **2**. This avoids the long diagonal from 10 to 2. (Path: 10-9-2)
*   Finally, from **2**, go left to **3**, which connects back to **1**. (Path: 2-3-1)

**Final Sequence:**
1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 2 -> 3 -> (back to 1)

1, 7, 8, 6, 4, 5, 10, 9, 2, 3
