To find the shortest tour for the 25 points, I'll identify clusters and trace a logical path that minimizes large jumps, essentially forming a distorted circular loop.

**1. Coordinate Analysis and Clustering:**
*   **Top/Right Cluster:** 1, 4, 10, 11, 17, 20, 25.
*   **Bottom/Right Cluster:** 2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 14, 16.
*   **Center Bridge:** 8, 12, 19, 21.
*   **Left Cluster:** 5, 9, 15, 18, 22, 23, 24.

**2. Path Construction:**
*   **Start at Top-Center:** Point **4** is a good connector between the top-left (25) and top-right (1).
*   **Right Loop:** From 4, go right to **1**, then up to **10, 17**, and the corner **11**. Come down the right edge to **20** and **6**. Continue to the bottom corner **14**, then inside to **16** and **7**.
*   **Bottom-Right Return:** From 7, move up to **2** and **3**, then inwards to **13** and **8**. Point 8 serves as the bridge to the center/left.
*   **Center/Left Transition:** From 8, go to **21**, then **19**, and down to **18**.
*   **Left Loop:** From 18, move to **9**, then sweep the bottom left corner **15, 24, 23, 22**. Move up to **5**.
*   **Closing the Cycle:** From 5, go to the isolated high point **12**, then **25**, which connects back to the start at **4**.

**3. Sequence:**
4 -> 1 -> 10 -> 17 -> 11 -> 20 -> 6 -> 14 -> 16 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 21 -> 19 -> 18 -> 9 -> 15 -> 24 -> 23 -> 22 -> 5 -> 12 -> 25 -> (back to 4).

**4. Final Verification:**
*   **4 -> 1:** Short hop.
*   **11 -> 20:** Longest necessary jump on the right, but optimal to preserve the outer hull order.
*   **7 -> 2:** Best exit from the bottom loop to the center.
*   **8 -> 21:** Short bridge.
*   **5 -> 12:** Best way to exit the left cluster towards the top.
*   **12 -> 25 -> 4:** Closes the loop efficiently.

The tour visits all 25 points exactly once.
