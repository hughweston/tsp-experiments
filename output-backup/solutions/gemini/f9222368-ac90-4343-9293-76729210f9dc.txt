To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given 15 points, I have analyzed the spatial distribution of the points and calculated the approximate distances to form the shortest cycle.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Clusters:**
    *   **Left Cluster:** Points 1, 2, 6, 8, 11.
    *   **Right/Top Cluster:** Points 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14.
    *   **Bottom Cluster:** Points 4, 10, 13, 15.

2.  **Path Construction:**
    *   Starting at **Point 1**, the nearest neighbors are 2 and 6. Point 6 leads towards the center bridge, so we go left first: **1 -> 2**.
    *   From **2**, go up to **8**, then to the top-left point **11**. Path so far: 1-2-8-11.
    *   From **11**, the best bridge to the right side is **5**. Path: ...11-5.
    *   From **5**, we need to visit the right side. **7** is tucked between 5 and 3. The most efficient detour is **5 -> 7 -> 3**.
    *   From **3**, proceed down the right edge: **3 -> 12 -> 14 -> 9**.
    *   From **9**, jump to the bottom-right corner **4**.
    *   From **4**, move inwards to the bottom cluster. The optimal sequence is **4 -> 15 -> 13 -> 10**.
    *   From **10**, bridge back to the left cluster at **6**.
    *   Finally, **6** connects back to **1** to close the loop.

**The Cycle:**
1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 11 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3 -> 12 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 15 -> 13 -> 10 -> 6 -> (back to 1)

1, 2, 8, 11, 5, 7, 3, 12, 14, 9, 4, 15, 13, 10, 6
