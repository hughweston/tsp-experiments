Based on the visual layout of the points, the points form three main clusters: a left cluster (2, 3, 4, 8), a middle cluster (1, 6, 7), and a right cluster (5, 9, 10). The optimal Traveling Salesman tour typically follows the perimeter of these clusters to form a loop, visiting internal points along the way.

1.  **Left Cluster & Bridge to Middle:** Starting from the left side, the points 2, 3, 8, 4 form a clear sequence. Point 2 (bottom) connects to 3 (left), which goes to 8 (middle-left), and then to 4 (top-left). Point 4 is the best point to bridge the gap to the middle cluster because it is closest to Point 1.
    *   Path so far: ... -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 ...

2.  **Middle Cluster:** From Point 4, we arrive at Point 1. From 1, the tour should go to Point 6 (top-middle) rather than 7, to maintain a clockwise or counter-clockwise sweep without crossing lines.
    *   Path so far: ... -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 ...

3.  **Bridge to Right Cluster:** From Point 6, the tour must cross the large gap to the right cluster. The most efficient connection is to Point 5 (top-right).
    *   Path so far: ... -> 6 -> 5 ...

4.  **Right Cluster:** After arriving at 5, the tour follows the outer edge to Point 10 (far right) and then sweeps back down to Point 9 (bottom-right).
    *   Path so far: ... -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 ...

5.  **Return Path:** From Point 9, the tour needs to return to the start. The closest point in the middle cluster is Point 7. From Point 7, the tour connects back to the starting cluster at Point 2, completing the loop.
    *   Path so far: ... -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 ...

**Full Sequence:**
Starting at Point 1 and following the loop described:
1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> (back to 1)
