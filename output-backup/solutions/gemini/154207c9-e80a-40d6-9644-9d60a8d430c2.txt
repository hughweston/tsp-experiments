Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour is found by tracing the outer perimeter while weaving inwards to capture the central points (9, 14) and the mid-right point (5) efficiently.

1.  **Start at 1** (Top Right).
2.  Go down to **4** (closest neighbor below).
3.  Go to **5** (very close neighbor to the left of 4).
4.  From 5, go to **7** (Bottom Right area).
5.  Continue the bottom loop: **8**, then **6**, then **2**.
6.  From 2, go up to **15** (Left/Bottom).
7.  Go to **10**, then **11** (Far Left).
8.  From 11, cross inwards to **14** (Center Left). *Note: This is a necessary long jump to close the loop, connecting the outer left shell to the center.*
9.  From 14, go to **9** (Center).
10. From 9, go up to **3** (Top Left).
11. Go to **12** (Top Middle).
12. Go to **13** (Top Right).
13. Finally, **13** connects back to **1**, completing the cycle.

1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 14, 9, 3, 12, 13
