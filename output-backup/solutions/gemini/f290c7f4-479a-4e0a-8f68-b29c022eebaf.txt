Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour is found by tracing the outer perimeter (convex hull) and making indentations to visit the inner points efficiently without crossing paths.

1.  **Bottom Edge**: Start at the bottom center and move right. The sequence is **1** $\rightarrow$ **9** $\rightarrow$ **13** (bottom-right corner).
2.  **Right Edge**: Move up the right side. **13** $\rightarrow$ **8** $\rightarrow$ **4**.
3.  **Right Indentation**: From point 4, dip inward to visit the central cluster before going to the top. The most efficient non-crossing path is **4** $\rightarrow$ **5** $\rightarrow$ **7** $\rightarrow$ **11** (top-right).
4.  **Top Edge**: Traverse the top arc from right to left. **11** $\rightarrow$ **6** $\rightarrow$ **10** $\rightarrow$ **3** (top-left).
5.  **Left Indentation**: From point 3, dip inward to visit the left-side inner points before finishing at the bottom-left. The path is **3** $\rightarrow$ **12** $\rightarrow$ **15**.
6.  **Closing the Loop**: From 15, go to the bottom-left corner and return towards the start. **15** $\rightarrow$ **14** $\rightarrow$ **2**. Point 2 connects back to 1.
