Based on the visual analysis of the point locations, here is the step-by-step logical deduction for the shortest tour:

1.  **Identify Clusters:**
    *   **Top Left:** Points 6 and 7.
    *   **Bottom Left:** Points 1 and 2.
    *   **Right Side Cluster:** Points 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10. Point 9 is at the top of this cluster, 8 is middle-left, 5 is lower-left, 3 and 10 are at the bottom, and 4 is middle-right.

2.  **Determine Global Flow:**
    The points form a rough circular pattern. A natural progression is to traverse the left side, cross to the right side, traverse the right cluster, and return to the left side.
    *   **Left Side Connection:** The path connecting the top-left (6, 7) and bottom-left (1, 2) clusters is most efficient as a vertical segment. Visually, 7 is above 1. The shortest path on the left involves the sequence **6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2**.
    *   **Bridges:** We need to connect the "ends" of the left chain (6 and 2) to the right cluster.
        *   **Top Bridge:** 6 is the natural connection to 9 (the top of the right cluster). So, **9 -> 6** (or vice versa).
        *   **Bottom Bridge:** 2 is the bottom-left corner. It needs to connect to the nearest point in the right cluster. The candidates are 8 and 5. Visually, the distance from 2 to 8 is slightly shorter and more direct than 2 to 5, and 8 serves as a better entry point to sweep the cluster.

3.  **Optimize Right Cluster Traversal:**
    Entering the right cluster at **8** (from 2) and exiting at **9** (to go to 6), we need to visit the remaining points (5, 3, 10, 4).
    *   From **8**, the nearest neighbor downwards is **5**.
    *   From **5**, move along the bottom to **3**.
    *   From **3**, continue right to **10**.
    *   From **10**, move up to **4**.
    *   From **4**, close the loop to the exit point **9**.
    This creates a smooth counter-clockwise path: **8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9**. This path minimizes criss-crossing and long jumps.

4.  **Construct Full Tour:**
    Combine the segments:
    *   Start at 1: **1 -> 2**
    *   Cross to right: **2 -> 8**
    *   Traverse right: **8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9**
    *   Cross to left: **9 -> 6**
    *   Complete left side: **6 -> 7**
    *   Close loop: **7 -> 1**

5.  **Final Sequence:**
    1, 2, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7

1, 2, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7
