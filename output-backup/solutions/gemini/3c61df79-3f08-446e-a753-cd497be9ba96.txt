To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given 25 points, I will determine the shortest path that visits every point exactly once and returns to the start.

1.  **Starting Point:** I'll start at point **1** on the far left.
2.  **Top-Left Cluster:** From 1, the nearest neighbor is 4. From 4, we go up to 3, then to 21, and 25 at the top.
    *   Path: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 21 -> 25
3.  **Top-Middle/Right Crossing:** From 25, the logical next step is 16. From 16, we visit the central point 22, then cross to the top-right section via 6.
    *   Path: ... -> 16 -> 22 -> 6
4.  **Top-Right Spur:** Points 20 and 12 form a spur. We visit them from 6 and loop back down. The best return path from the isolated point 12 is to 8.
    *   Path: ... -> 6 -> 20 -> 12 -> 8
5.  **Right-Side Descent:** From 8, we weave down through the cluster 15, 5, and 10.
    *   Path: ... -> 8 -> 15 -> 5 -> 10
6.  **Bottom-Right Corner:** From 10, we go to 11, then the corner 23, and sweep leftwards through 14 and 9 to 24.
    *   Path: ... -> 10 -> 11 -> 23 -> 14 -> 9 -> 24
7.  **Bottom-Left Return:** From 24, we jump across the gap to 13. Then we trace the bottom edge points 7 and 18, and move up through 17, 19, and 2.
    *   Path: ... -> 24 -> 13 -> 7 -> 18 -> 17 -> 19 -> 2
8.  **Closing:** Finally, point 2 connects back to the start point 1 to close the loop.

**Final Ordered List:**

1, 4, 3, 21, 25, 16, 22, 6, 20, 12, 8, 15, 5, 10, 11, 23, 14, 9, 24, 13, 7, 18, 17, 19, 2
