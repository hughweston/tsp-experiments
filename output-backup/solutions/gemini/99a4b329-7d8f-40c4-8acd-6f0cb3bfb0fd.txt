Based on the visual analysis of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instance with 30 points, here is the step-by-step derivation of the shortest tour:

1.  **Right Edge (Downwards):** Starting at point **1**, the path moves south along the right boundary to **25**, then **26**, and inwards to **5**.
2.  **Bottom Right Cluster:** From 5, the tour sweeps through the bottom-right cluster: **19**, **15**, and **23**.
3.  **Bottom Center:** From 23, it moves west to the central bottom point **9**, then loops through **2** and **12**.
4.  **Bottom Left Corner:** Continuing west, the path visits **6**, **30**, and reaches the bottom-left corner at **20**. It then tucks inside to **16** before going to **29**.
5.  **Left Edge (Upwards):** From 29, it travels up the left side through **8** and **14**, reaching the top-left corner at **7**.
6.  **Diagonal Bridge:** From 7, the tour makes a necessary jump to the center-left cluster, hitting **27**, then moving up the diagonal to **22** and **4**.
7.  **Center/Right Cluster:** From 4, the path enters the dense group on the right. It goes to **21**, then **17**, then **3**.
8.  **Top Arc:** From 3, it jumps to the top group starting at **13**, then follows the arc eastward through **10**, **28**, and **24**, reaching the top-right peak at **11**.
9.  **Closing the Loop:** From 11, the path descends to **18**, which connects back to the starting point **1**.
