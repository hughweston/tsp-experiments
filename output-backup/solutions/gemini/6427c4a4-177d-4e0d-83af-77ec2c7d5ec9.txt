To find the shortest tour for the 20 points in the Traveling Salesman Problem, we analyze the spatial distribution of the points and form a logical loop that minimizes travel distance.

1.  **Right Cluster & Descent**: Starting from the mid-right, point **2** is centrally located in that group. Moving to **3** and then **17** covers the inner right section efficiently. From 17, we move to the outer edge at **15**.
2.  **Right Edge**: We traverse the right edge upwards: **15** -> **18** -> **4** -> **14**.
3.  **Top Edge**: From the top right, we move leftwards: **14** -> **19** -> **6** -> **13** -> **20**.
4.  **Left Descent**: From the top-left corner (20), we move down to **5**.
5.  **Left Internal**: From 5, **7** is the closest logical step inward before heading to the far left edge via **10**.
6.  **Bottom Left Loop**: From 10, we go to the far left **8**, then follow the bottom edge: **8** -> **12** -> **9**.
7.  **Bottom to Center Return**: From 9, the path continues to **16** (bottom center). From 16, we must make the jump back up to the center cluster. The most efficient connection is to **11**.
8.  **Closing the Loop**: From 11, we go to **1** and then return to **2**, completing the cycle (since 2 and 1 are close neighbors).

Cycle verification:
... 16 -> 9 -> 12 -> 8 -> 10 -> 7 -> 5 -> 20 -> 13 -> 6 -> 19 -> 14 -> 4 -> 18 -> 15 -> 17 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11 -> (back to 16).

Re-ordering to start the list with point 1 for consistency (any start point is valid):

1, 11, 16, 9, 12, 8, 10, 7, 5, 20, 13, 6, 19, 14, 4, 18, 15, 17, 3, 2
