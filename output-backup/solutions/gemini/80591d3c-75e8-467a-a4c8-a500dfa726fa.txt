Based on the visual positions of the points, we can determine the shortest tour by identifying the convex hull (the outer boundary of points) and inserting the internal point(s) into the sequence where they cause the least detour.

1.  **Identify the Convex Hull**: Looking at the image, the points forming the outer perimeter are roughly **1** (left), **5** (top-left), **7** (top), **6** (top-right), **2** (right), **3** (bottom-right), **10** (bottom), **9** (bottom-left), and **8** (bottom-left corner).
    *   Following the perimeter clockwise starting from 1: **1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 1**.

2.  **Insert Internal Point (4)**: Point **4** is located inside this outer loop, specifically in the right-hand area between points 6, 2, and 7.
    *   We need to insert point 4 into the perimeter sequence between two consecutive points such that the total distance increase is minimized.
    *   **Between 7 and 6?** Point 4 is quite far below the line connecting 7 and 6.
    *   **Between 6 and 2?** Point 4 is located roughly between 6 and 2 vertically and horizontally. Point 6 is top-right, Point 2 is mid-right. Point 4 is slightly to the left of the line connecting them. The distances from 6 to 4 and 4 to 2 are relatively short. This looks like the natural "indentation" of the path.
    *   **Between 2 and 3?** Point 4 is significantly above point 3, so going 2->4->3 would involve backtracking upwards.
    *   **Conclusion**: The optimal insertion is between 6 and 2.

3.  **Construct Final Path**:
    *   Start at **1**.
    *   Go up to **5**.
    *   Go right to **7**.
    *   Go right to **6**.
    *   Inward to **4**.
    *   Outward to **2**.
    *   Down to **3**.
    *   Left to **10**.
    *   Left to **9**.
    *   Left to **8**.
    *   (And back to 1).

4.  **Final Sequence**: 1, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2, 3, 10, 9, 8.

1, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2, 3, 10, 9, 8
