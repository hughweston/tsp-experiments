To find the shortest tour for the 30 points shown in the image, we can construct a path that minimizes distance by following the visual clusters and the "convex hull" (outer boundary) while weaving in the internal points where appropriate.

**Step-by-Step Path Construction:**

1.  **Start at Top-Left (26):** Begin at point **26**. Go down to its nearest neighbor **12**, then to **17**.
2.  **Left Edge Sweep:** From 17, visit the outlier **27**, then move to **29**, and over to **6**.
3.  **Bottom Edge:** From 6, go down to **18**, then to **11**.
4.  **Bottom-Center Cluster:** From 11, dip up slightly to pick up **4** and **2**, then go down to **19**, over to **28**, and to the corner **7**.
5.  **Right Side Sweep (Upwards):** From 7, move up/left to **21**, then to **25**, and right to **24**. From 24, go up to **16**.
6.  **Far Right Cluster:** From 16, go to the outlier **13**, then to **3**, and **22**.
7.  **Top Right:** From 22, go up to **9**, then **10**, and left to **30**.
8.  **Top-Center & Closing the Loop:** From 30, go down to **15**, then left to **14**. From 14, drop down to pick up the center column **8**, **5**, and **1**. Finally, move up from 1 to **23**, then to **20**, which connects back to the start (26).

**Detailed Sequence:**
