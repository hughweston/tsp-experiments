Based on the visual analysis of point locations and clustering, here is the shortest path (tour) that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the start.

The tour follows a general counter-clockwise direction, starting from the top-left, going down the left side, sweeping across the bottom, moving up through the scattered central points, then traversing the right side bottom-to-top, and finally closing the loop across the top.

1.  Start at **3** (top left).
2.  Go down to **20** and then **14**.
3.  Visit **1** (situated between 14 and 17).
4.  Continue down to **17**, **10**, and **8** (bottom left).
5.  Move right to **2**, then up to **23**.
6.  Visit the central cluster: **25**, then **15**, then **6**, then **21**.
7.  Move towards the right side via **19** and **22**.
8.  Sweep the bottom-right section: **11**, **9**, **4**, **18**, **7**.
9.  Move up the right edge: **24**, **5**, **12**.
10. Traverse the top edge back to the start: **16**, **13**, and return to **3**.
