Based on the visual analysis of the points and their relative distances, here is the shortest tour (Traveling Salesman Path).

1.  **Start at Point 4** (top-middle).
2.  Go left to **Point 10** (top-left).
3.  Go down to **Point 3** (neighbor to 10).
4.  Continue down to **Point 6** (close to 3).
5.  Go slightly right to **Point 1** (very close neighbor to 6).
6.  Go down-left to **Point 7** (bottom-left corner). *Note: Although the edge 1-7 is long, it is more efficient than the alternatives which require traversing longer return paths.*
7.  Go right to **Point 5** (bottom-middle).
8.  Go up-right to **Point 9** (middle-right).
9.  Go up-right to **Point 8** (top-right corner).
10. Go down-left to **Point 2** (neighbor to 8 and 4).
11. Return to **Point 4** to close the loop.

4, 10, 3, 6, 1, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2
