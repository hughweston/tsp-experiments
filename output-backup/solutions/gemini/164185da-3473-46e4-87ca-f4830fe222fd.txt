To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 20 points, we can visualize the points as a geometric graph and aim to connect nearest neighbors while forming a single closed loop without crossing lines.

1.  **Identify Clusters and Edges:**
    *   **Top/Left:** 14, 6, 10.
    *   **Top/Center:** 13, 16, 20, 11.
    *   **Right:** 4, 7, 1, 2, 3.
    *   **Bottom:** 15, 5, 12, 19, 17.
    *   **Center/Internal:** 8, 9, 18.

2.  **Constructing the Path:**
    *   Start at the top-left with point **14**.
    *   Move inward to **13**, then to **16**.
    *   From 16, pick up the central point **8**, then move to **20** and up to **11**.
    *   Descend the right side: **11** -> **4** -> **7**.
    *   Continue down the right edge: **7** -> **3** -> **1** -> **2**.
    *   Move along the bottom: **2** -> **15** -> **5**.
    *   From 5, go to the nearby point **12**, then move inward to **9**.
    *   From 9, move left to **18**, then down-left to **17**.
    *   From 17, drop to **19**, then take the long necessary jump up to **10**.
    *   From 10, go up to **6** and close the loop back to **14**.

3.  **Path Verification:**
    *   The sequence covers the perimeter effectively while weaving in the central points (8, 9, 18) at logical spots to minimize detour distances.
    *   Segments like 16-8-20 and 12-9-18 keep the connections relatively short compared to crossing the entire graph.

**Final Tour Order:**
14, 13, 16, 8, 20, 11, 4, 7, 3, 1, 2, 15, 5, 12, 9, 18, 17, 19, 10, 6
