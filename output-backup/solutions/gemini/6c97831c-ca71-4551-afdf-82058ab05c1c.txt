To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for these 15 points, I'll analyze the spatial distribution and clustering of the points to form an efficient loop.

**1. Point Coordinates Estimation (Relative):**
*   **Top-Left Cluster:** 11 (far left), 15, 12, 6 (top peak).
*   **Bottom-Left:** 7 (isolated).
*   **Left-Mid:** 5.
*   **Center Column:** 3 (top), 13, 4, 14 (bottom).
*   **Center-Right:** 10, 2 (below 10), 8 (right of 10).
*   **Right/Bottom-Right:** 9 (far right), 1 (bottom right).

**2. Logical Path Construction:**
*   **Start at the Top-Left:** The chain **11 -> 15 -> 12 -> 6** is very tightly grouped.
*   **Bridge to the Right:** From point 6, there is a large gap to the rest of the points. The most efficient way to encompass the far-right point 9 without creating a dead-end later is to cross this gap now. The best connection is **6 -> 9**. Although long, alternatives create more total distance or awkward crossings.
*   **Right Side Descent:** From 9, the closest point inwards is 8. From 8, we go to 10. From 10, we go down to 2. From 2, we go to the bottom-right corner 1.
    *   Path so far: **... 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1**
*   **Bottom Sweep:** From 1, we move left to the bottom center 14. 14 is the gateway to the isolated corner point 7. To visit 7 and return, we must pass through its closest neighbors. The sequence **14 -> 7 -> 4** efficiently covers this corner.
    *   Path segment: **1 -> 14 -> 7 -> 4**
*   **Center Ascent:** Now we are at 4. We need to move up the central spine. 4 connects to 13, and 13 connects to 3.
    *   Path segment: **4 -> 13 -> 3**
*   **Closing the Loop:** From 3, we move left to 5. 5 is the bridge back to our starting area. From 5, we connect back to 11.
    *   Path segment: **3 -> 5 -> 11**

**3. Full Cycle Verification:**
*   11 -> 15 -> 12 -> 6 (Top cluster)
*   6 -> 9 (Bridge)
*   9 -> 8 -> 10 -> 2 (Right side down)
*   2 -> 1 (Bottom right)
*   1 -> 14 -> 7 -> 4 (Bottom sweep)
*   4 -> 13 -> 3 (Center up)
*   3 -> 5 -> 11 (Return to start)

This path forms a non-intersecting loop that visits every point.

**Final List:**
11, 15, 12, 6, 9, 8, 10, 2, 1, 14, 7, 4, 13, 3, 5
