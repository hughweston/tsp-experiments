To find the shortest tour visiting all 15 points, I have analyzed the spatial distribution of the points and estimated the distances between them to construct an optimized path.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Point Cluster Identification**:
    *   **Bottom-Right**: Points 1, 6, 14 form a tight group at the bottom right.
    *   **Right-Mid**: Points 11, 12, 8 form a vertical chain ascending on the right.
    *   **Top-Right**: Points 15 and 3 are outliers at the top right.
    *   **Top-Center**: Points 5, 9, 13 form a cluster at the top.
    *   **Left**: Points 7, 10, 2 form the left boundary.
    *   **Bottom-Left**: Point 4 is somewhat isolated but bridges the left group and the bottom group.

2.  **Path Construction (Counter-Clockwise approach starting from Point 1)**:
    *   Start at **1** (bottom right).
    *   Go up to **11** (closest neighbor upwards).
    *   Continue up to **12**.
    *   From 12, **8** is the next logical step up/left.
    *   From 8, visit the far right point **15**.
    *   From 15, go to the top corner **3**.
    *   From 3, move left to **5**.
    *   From 5, drop slightly down-right to visit **9** (which is efficiently located between 5 and 13).
    *   From 9, move left to **13**.
    *   From 13, move down-left to **10**.
    *   From 10, go to the far left point **7**.
    *   From 7, move down to **2**.
    *   From 2, move down-right to **4**.
    *   From 4, move right along the bottom to **14**.
    *   From 14, go to **6**, which brings us back next to 1 to close the loop.

**Verification of tricky segments:**
*   **5 -> 9 -> 13 vs 5 -> 13 -> 9**: The path 5->9->13->10 is more efficient than 5->13->9->10 because while 5->13 is short, the connection from 9 to 10 is much longer than 13 to 10.
*   **12 -> 8 -> 15 vs 12 -> 15 -> 8**: 12->8->15->3 is slightly shorter and follows a smoother curve than zigzagging 12->15->8->3.
*   **Bottom Loop**: The sequence 4 -> 14 -> 6 -> 1 -> 11 -> 12 minimizes the long jumps across the bottom area.

**Final Path Sequence:**
1 -> 11 -> 12 -> 8 -> 15 -> 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 13 -> 10 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 14 -> 6 -> (1)
