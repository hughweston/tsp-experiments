To find the shortest tour for the given TSP instance with 20 points, we analyze the spatial clusters and distances between nearest neighbors.

1.  **Identify Clusters:**
    *   **Top-Left:** Points 17, 3, 15.
    *   **Top-Middle:** Points 5, 19, 8, 11.
    *   **Top-Right:** Points 14, 1, 7.
    *   **Far-Right:** Points 10, 9.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** Points 4, 6, 18.
    *   **Bottom-Middle:** Points 16, 20, 2.
    *   **Bottom-Left:** Points 12, 13.

2.  **Construct the Path:**
    *   We can start at point **1** in the top-right cluster.
    *   From **1**, the nearest neighbors are 14 and 11. To form a cycle that covers the top edge efficiently, we go to **11** and then **8**.
    *   From **8**, we move left to **19**, then to **5**.
    *   From **5**, the optimal entry into the top-left cluster is **15**. We then visit **17** and **3**.
    *   From **3**, there is a large gap to the bottom section. The closest connection is to **12**.
    *   From **12**, we must visit the corner point **13** before moving right to **2**.
    *   From **2**, we proceed along the bottom chain: **20**, then **16**.
    *   From **16**, we bridge the gap to the right side cluster starting with **18**, then **6**, then **4**.
    *   From **4**, we go to the far right points **9** and **10**.
    *   From **10**, we must close the loop by returning to the top area. The best connection is the long jump to **7**.
    *   From **7**, we go to **14**, which brings us back to our starting neighbor **1**.

3.  **Final Sequence:**
    1 -> 11 -> 8 -> 19 -> 5 -> 15 -> 17 -> 3 -> 12 -> 13 -> 2 -> 20 -> 16 -> 18 -> 6 -> 4 -> 9 -> 10 -> 7 -> 14 -> (back to 1)

1, 11, 8, 19, 5, 15, 17, 3, 12, 13, 2, 20, 16, 18, 6, 4, 9, 10, 7, 14
