To find the shortest tour visiting all 30 points, we can break the problem into logical clusters and connect them to minimize the lengths of the "jumps" between clusters.

**1. Cluster Analysis:**
*   **Bottom Left:** Points 6, 12, 8.
*   **Bottom Right / Right:** A large chain including 4, 26, 1, 25, 7, 29, 11, 5, 21, 18, 2.
*   **Center:** Points 17, 24, 9, 28.
*   **Top Left:** The densest cluster containing 15, 10, 23, 16, 27, 30, 13, 22, 19, 20, 14, 3.

**2. Path Construction:**
*   **Start at 6 (Bottom Left).**
*   Move right along the bottom: **6 -> 12 -> 8**.
*   Connect to the central/bottom group: **8 -> 17 -> 24**.
*   Swing into the bottom right corner: **24 -> 1 -> 4**.
*   Sweep up the right side: **4 -> 26 -> 25 -> 7 -> 29 -> 11 -> 5 -> 21 -> 18 -> 2**.
*   Cross back towards the center top: **2 -> 28 -> 9**.
*   Jump to the Top-Left cluster (entering at the nearest point): **9 -> 20**.
*   Traverse the Top-Left cluster in a loop that ends near the start point (6):
    *   **20 -> 19 -> 22 -> 13 -> 3 -> 30 -> 27 -> 16 -> 23 -> 10 -> 15 -> 14**.
*   Finally, the loop closes naturally from **14 back to 6** (this is the necessary long edge to complete the cycle).

**3. Final Sequence:**
6, 12, 8, 17, 24, 1, 4, 26, 25, 7, 29, 11, 5, 21, 18, 2, 28, 9, 20, 19, 22, 13, 3, 30, 27, 16, 23, 10, 15, 14

6, 12, 8, 17, 24, 1, 4, 26, 25, 7, 29, 11, 5, 21, 18, 2, 28, 9, 20, 19, 22, 13, 3, 30, 27, 16, 23, 10, 15, 14
