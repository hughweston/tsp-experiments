Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, the shortest tour follows the outer boundary of the points while dipping inward to visit the interior points in a way that minimizes travel distance.

Here is the step-by-step logic for the path:
1.  **Start at the top cluster**: Begin at point **1**, go to its closest neighbor **10**, then **11**.
2.  **Top Right**: Continue right to **9**. From here, the path goes to the far top-right point **12**, and then comes back in to **8**. This sequence (9-12-8) is more efficient than 9-8-12 because it avoids the very long edge required to leave 12 if it were visited last in this section.
3.  **Right Side**: From 8, move down to **14**.
4.  **Bottom Right**: From 14, visit the bottom-right corner. The optimal traversal is **3** then **5** then **15**. This loop (14-3-5-15) minimizes crossing and total distance compared to other permutations.
5.  **Bottom Center**: From 15, move left to **2**.
6.  **Left Side**: From 2, move up to **4**, then left to **7**.
7.  **Far Left**: From 7, go out to the far left point **13**.
8.  **Close the Loop**: From 13, the most logical connection back to the start is to **6**, which then connects back to 1 to complete the cycle.
