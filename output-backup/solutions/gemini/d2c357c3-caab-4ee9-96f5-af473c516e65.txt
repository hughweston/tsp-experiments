To find the shortest tour visiting all 20 points, we can visualize the points as a geometric map and apply a logical "nearest neighbor" or perimeter-sweep strategy to form a closed loop.

1.  **Analyze Clusters:**
    *   **Bottom Chain:** Points 1, 9, 20 are the bottom edge. Points 12, 16 are slightly above 20. Point 17 is to the right of 16. Point 8 is the bottom-right corner.
    *   **Right Edge:** From 8, the path goes up to 3, then 4 is the top-right corner.
    *   **Top Block:** Points 14, 18, 2, 19 form a band below the top edge. 13 is the highest point.
    *   **Left Edge:** Point 11 is the top-left corner. 7 and 10 are below it. 6 is the mid-left point connecting to the bottom.
    *   **Center:** Points 15 and 5 are in the middle, bridging the top-left and mid-left sections.

2.  **Constructing the Path:**
    *   **Start at 1 (Bottom-Left):** Move right along the bottom. 1 $\rightarrow$ 9 $\rightarrow$ 20.
    *   **Bottom "Bump":** From 20, visit the inner points 12 and 16 before going to 17. The sequence 20 $\rightarrow$ 12 $\rightarrow$ 16 $\rightarrow$ 17 is efficient and minimizes crossing.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** From 17, go to the corner 8.
    *   **Right Side:** From 8, go up to 3. From 3, go to the top-right corner 4.
    *   **Top-Right Inward Sweep:** From 4, sweep leftwards through the dense upper-right cluster. 4 $\rightarrow$ 14 $\rightarrow$ 18 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 19. This zig-zag captures the points efficiently.
    *   **Top-Left:** From 19, go up to 13, then down to the corner 11.
    *   **Left Descent:** From 11, go inward to 7, then 10.
    *   **Center Connection:** From 10, go to 15 (center), then down to 5 (lower-center).
    *   **Return to Start:** From 5, go left to 6, which connects vertically back down to 1 to close the loop.

3.  **Final Sequence:**
    1 $\rightarrow$ 9 $\rightarrow$ 20 $\rightarrow$ 12 $\rightarrow$ 16 $\rightarrow$ 17 $\rightarrow$ 8 $\rightarrow$ 3 $\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow$ 14 $\rightarrow$ 18 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 19 $\rightarrow$ 13 $\rightarrow$ 11 $\rightarrow$ 7 $\rightarrow$ 10 $\rightarrow$ 15 $\rightarrow$ 5 $\rightarrow$ 6

1, 9, 20, 12, 16, 17, 8, 3, 4, 14, 18, 2, 19, 13, 11, 7, 10, 15, 5, 6
