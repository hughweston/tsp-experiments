To find the shortest tour visiting all 25 points, I have analyzed the spatial distribution of the points and their relative distances. The points form two main clusters (lobes), a left one and a right one, connected by "bridges" at the top and bottom.

1.  **Left Cluster Analysis:** Points 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 20, 23, 12, 6.
    *   The "snake" 1-13-5-11-3 covers the bottom left efficiently.
    *   The top left corner is best traversed as 17-23-20-7-12-6, which leads towards the bridge to the right cluster.
    *   Connection between lobes: Point 6 is close to Point 2. Point 3 is the closest point to Point 10 in the bottom gap.

2.  **Right Cluster Analysis:** Points 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25.
    *   Starting from the top bridge at point 2, the path logically flows 2 -> 21 -> 19 -> 22 -> 25 -> 16 -> 4 -> 18 -> 9 -> 24 -> 15. This winds from the top, through the dense middle-right section, down to the bottom right.
    *   From 15, the path needs to return to the left side. The sequence 15 -> 8 -> 14 -> 10 works well, utilizing the proximity of 8 and 14 to bridge the vertical gap in the center.

3.  **Connecting the Path:**
    *   **Start at 1.**
    *   Go down: 1 -> 13 -> 5 -> 11 -> 3.
    *   Cross to Right Cluster: 3 -> 10.
    *   Go up the center/right: 10 -> 14 -> 8 -> 15.
    *   Loop the right edge: 15 -> 24 -> 9 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16.
    *   Loop the top right: 16 -> 25 -> 22 -> 19 -> 21 -> 2.
    *   Cross to Left Cluster: 2 -> 6.
    *   Loop the top left: 6 -> 12 -> 7 -> 20 -> 23.
    *   Return to start: 23 -> 17 -> 1.

This path minimizes long jumps, particularly crossing the central voids efficiently at 3-10 and 2-6, and handling the internal density of the right cluster without backtracking.
