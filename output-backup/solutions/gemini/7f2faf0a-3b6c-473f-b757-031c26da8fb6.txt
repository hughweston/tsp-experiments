To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 20 points, I have analyzed the spatial distribution of the points and applied a heuristic approach to minimize the total path distance. The points form a rough "C" shape or loop with some internal points.

**Step-by-step path construction:**
1.  **Bottom Cluster:** Starting at point **1**, the nearest neighbors are 2 and 6. Following the bottom edge to the left leads to **6**, then **5**, and then the corner **3**.
2.  **Left Side:** From **3**, moving up the left side connects to **20**, then **16**, and **17**.
3.  **Top Left Transition:** From **17**, the path continues up to **9**, which bridges the gap to the isolated point **14** in the top left.
4.  **Top Edge:** From **14**, the only logical move is rightward to **18**. Continuing along the top, we visit **19** and then the dense cluster in the top right.
5.  **Top Right Cluster:** The most efficient traversal of this group is to go to the corner **10**, then down to **7**, **15**, and finally **12**.
6.  **Center/Descent:** From **12**, we need to move towards the center and bottom right. Visiting **4** on the way to **11** is efficient (minimizing detour cost).
7.  **Bottom Right Turn:** From **11**, we go down to **8**. To visit the far corner point **13** efficiently, we go from 8 to **13**, and then return slightly left to **2**, which closes the loop back to our starting point **1**.

**Final Tour Sequence:**
1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18 -> 19 -> 10 -> 7 -> 15 -> 12 -> 4 -> 11 -> 8 -> 13 -> 2

1, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17, 9, 14, 18, 19, 10, 7, 15, 12, 4, 11, 8, 13, 2
