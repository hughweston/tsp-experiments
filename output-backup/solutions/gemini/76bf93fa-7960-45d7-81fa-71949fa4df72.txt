To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 15 points, we analyze the spatial clusters and the distances between points.

1.  **Cluster Analysis:**
    *   **Bottom-Left:** Points 12, 14, 15 are grouped together. Point 12 is in the corner and must connect to 14 and 15 to minimize distance.
    *   **Top-Left:** Points 4, 8, 5, 7 form a cluster. A logical path through them avoids crossing lines (e.g., 15 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7).
    *   **Top-Right:** Points 9, 10, 13, 6 form a cluster. The sequence 9 -> 10 -> 13 -> 6 minimizes the perimeter.
    *   **Center/Bottom-Right:** Points 1, 11, 2, 3. Point 11 is very close to 1. Point 3 is an outlier in the bottom right corner, likely connecting to 2 and making a long jump to 13.

2.  **Path Construction:**
    *   Starting at the **Center** with point **11**, the closest neighbor is **1**.
    *   From **1**, moving to **2** is efficient.
    *   From **2**, go to the corner point **3**.
    *   From **3**, the best option to continue the loop is a long jump north to **13**.
    *   From **13**, traverse the top right: **10** -> **6** is a small detour, but **6** fits well between **10** and **9** geographically. Let's trace: **13 -> 10 -> 6 -> 9**. (Actually, geometrically 10->6->9 works well).
    *   From **9**, move left to the top-left cluster: **7**.
    *   Traverse the top-left: **7 -> 5 -> 4 -> 8**.
    *   From **8**, move down to the mid-left: **15**.
    *   From **15**, go to the bottom-left corner **12**.
    *   From **12**, return via **14**.
    *   From **14**, close the loop back to **11**.

3.  **Refining the Sequence:**
    Let's verify the connections:
    *   11 -> 1 (Very short)
    *   1 -> 2 (Short)
    *   2 -> 3 (Short)
    *   3 -> 13 (Long, unavoidable gap)
    *   13 -> 10 (Short)
    *   10 -> 6 (Short)
    *   6 -> 9 (Short)
    *   9 -> 7 (Medium)
    *   7 -> 5 (Short)
    *   5 -> 4 (Short)
    *   4 -> 8 (Very short)
    *   8 -> 15 (Medium)
    *   15 -> 12 (Medium)
    *   12 -> 14 (Medium)
    *   14 -> 11 (Medium) - Loop closed.

    This path forms a coherent counter-clockwise spiral without crossing itself.

4.  **Final List:**
    Starting from point 1 for the output.

1, 2, 3, 13, 10, 6, 9, 7, 5, 4, 8, 15, 12, 14, 11
