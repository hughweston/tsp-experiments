To find the shortest tour visiting all 20 points, we analyze the spatial clusters and the most logical connections between them to form a single cycle.

1.  **Cluster Analysis:**
    *   **Top-Right:** Points 8, 9, 6, 16, 10, 15. This group is dense.
    *   **Top-Middle:** Points 20, 14, 7. These form a bridge to the left.
    *   **Left Side:** Points 2, 17, 18, 4, 12, 11. These form a chain going down the left side.
    *   **Bottom/Center:** Points 19, 13, 5. Point 19 is a central hub connecting the left side to the bottom right.
    *   **Right-Middle:** Points 3, 1. These connect the bottom group back to the top-right.

2.  **Path Construction:**
    *   **Top-Right:** Starting from point **1**, the nearest logical neighbor to start the cluster traversal is **15**. From 15, we sweep through the cluster: **10** (closest up-left) -> **16** (right/down) -> **6** (up/right) -> **9** (left) -> **8** (left).
    *   **Top-Middle:** From 8, the jump is to the next cluster at **20**. The path naturally follows the line **20 -> 14 -> 7**.
    *   **Left Side:** From 7, we go down to **2**. Then the path winds down the left edge: **2 -> 17**. From 17, we go to the outlier **18**, then down to **4**, then **12** (bottom-left corner), and back up/right to **11**.
    *   **Center/Bottom:** Point 11 needs to connect to the rest of the graph. The only viable bridge is **19**. From 19, the path must go down to the isolated bottom section: **19 -> 13**. From 13, go right to **5**.
    *   **Closing the Loop:** From 5, go up to **3**. From 3, close the loop back to **1**.

3.  **Sequence Verification:**
    *   1 -> 15 -> 10 -> 16 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 7 -> 2 -> 17 -> 18 -> 4 -> 12 -> 11 -> 19 -> 13 -> 5 -> 3 -> (back to 1).

This path minimizes long jumps and visits every point exactly once.
