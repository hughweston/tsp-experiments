To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with the given 10 points, we can analyze the spatial distribution of the points and connect nearest neighbors to form a cycle without crossing lines (a simple polygon).

**Analysis of Point Locations:**
- **Cluster 1 (Bottom Left):** Points **3** and **4**. Point 4 is the leftmost point, and 3 is slightly below and to the right of 4.
- **Cluster 2 (Center Left):** Points **1**, **2**, and **10**. Points 1 and 2 are close together, with 1 to the left. Point 10 is below this pair.
- **Cluster 3 (Center):** Point **9** is centrally located.
- **Cluster 4 (Right / Top Right):** Points **5**, **6**, **7**, and **8**. Point 5 is far bottom-right. Point 8 is the highest point, with 6 close by. Point 7 is between the top pair (6,8) and the bottom point (5).

**Constructing the Path:**
1.  **Start at Point 1:** From point 1, the nearest neighbor is clearly point **2**.
    *   Path: 1 → 2
2.  **Bridge to Right Side:** From point 2, the most logical connection to the right cluster that avoids crossing later paths is to the top right. Point **6** is a long jump, but necessary to traverse the points in a loop. Point 9 is closer, but going 2→9 creates difficulties in visiting 6 and 8 efficiently later. Let's assume the outer boundary path 2 → 6.
    *   Path: 1 → 2 → 6
3.  **Top Right Cluster:** From point 6, the nearest neighbor is **8**. From 8, we move down to **7**.
    *   Path: ... 6 → 8 → 7
4.  **Bottom Right:** From 7, the only logical step is down to **5**.
    *   Path: ... 7 → 5
5.  **Return to Center:** From point 5 (bottom right), we must return towards the left. The best connector is point **9** (center).
    *   Path: ... 5 → 9
6.  **Center to Left:** From point 9, the closest unvisited point in the left cluster is **10**.
    *   Path: ... 9 → 10
7.  **Bottom Left:** From 10, we go down to point **3**. From 3, the nearest point is **4**.
    *   Path: ... 10 → 3 → 4
8.  **Closing the Loop:** From point 4, we return to the start point **1**.
    *   Full Cycle: 1 → 2 → 6 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 9 → 10 → 3 → 4 → (1)

**Verification:**
- **Segments:** 1-2 (Short), 2-6 (Long bridge), 6-8 (Short), 8-7 (Medium), 7-5 (Medium), 5-9 (Long bridge), 9-10 (Short), 10-3 (Medium), 3-4 (Short), 4-1 (Medium).
- **Crossings:** The path forms a clean loop. The line 2-6 goes over the top, while 5-9 cuts back through the lower middle, avoiding intersection with the 2-6 line or the right-side vertical segments. The loop 10-3-4-1 stays in the bottom left corner without self-intersection.

**Final Visit Order:**
1, 2, 6, 8, 7, 5, 9, 10, 3, 4
