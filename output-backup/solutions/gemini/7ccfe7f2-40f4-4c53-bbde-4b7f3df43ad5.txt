Based on the visual analysis of the point locations and clustering, the shortest tour follows this logic:

1.  **Start at the central point 1.**
2.  Move **upwards** to the top-middle cluster: **5, 11, 4**. The sequence 1 -> 5 -> 11 -> 4 is efficient as these points are vertically aligned.
3.  From 4, move **right** to visit **14** and **8**. This clears the top-right corner.
4.  From 8 (top-right), perform a long jump **across the top** to **12** (top-left). This is a necessary long segment to connect the clusters.
5.  From 12, move **down the left side** to **15** and then **3**.
6.  From 3, sweep the **bottom-left cluster**. The most efficient path is **6 -> 9 -> 7** (or 3->6->9->7), as 6 is the leftmost point, 9 is slightly inward, and 7 is the bottom-most point. The order 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 minimizes the jump to 7.
7.  From 7, move **right** along the bottom to **10** and then **2** (bottom-right corner).
8.  From 2, move **up** to **13** (middle-right).
9.  From 13, close the loop back to **1** (center).

This path creates a coherent loop that visits all clusters with minimal backtracking and efficient transitions between the disparate groups.

1, 5, 11, 4, 14, 8, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13
