Based on the visual clustering and relative positions of the points, the shortest tour is constructed by connecting nearest neighbors while maintaining a consistent cycle that generally follows the perimeter and weaves through the center where appropriate.

Here is the step-by-step logic for the determined path:
1.  **Top Left:** Start at **21**, go left to **7**, then down to **1**, left to **29**, down to **27**, right to **28**, down to **10**, down to **6**.
2.  **Bottom Left:** From **6**, go right to **18**, then right to **20**.
3.  **Center/Bottom:** From **20**, go up/right to **8**, then down to **5**, down to **9**, right to **11**, down to **3**, right to **16** (bottom-most point).
4.  **Bottom Right:** From **16**, go up to **4**, right to **12**, right to **23**, right to **22**, up/left to **17**.
5.  **Top Right:** From **17**, go left/up to **24**, up/left to **2**, left to **30**, right/up to **14**, up/right to **19**, left to **15**, left to **26**.
6.  **Closing the Loop:** From **26**, go down/left to **13**, left/down to **25**, and finally connect back to **21** (25 is reasonably close to 21 to close the loop).
