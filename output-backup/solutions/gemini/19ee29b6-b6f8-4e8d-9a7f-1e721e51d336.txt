To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given 25 points, we first analyze the spatial distribution of the points to identify logical clusters and a smooth path that minimizes total distance.

**Analysis of Point Locations (Approximate):**
- **Top Region:** Points 10 (top-left), 22, 17, 2, 5 (top-center), 6, 11 (top-right).
- **Right Edge:** Points 6, 11, 8, 15, 3.
- **Bottom-Right Cluster:** Points 9, 13, 18.
- **Middle-Right/Center Cluster:** Points 14, 12, 21, 23, 24.
- **Bottom-Center:** Points 20, 1, 25.
- **Bottom-Left Tail:** Points 4, 7, 19.
- **Left-Connector:** Point 16.

**Path Construction Strategy:**
1.  **Bottom Tail:** Starting at the bottom-left corner, the sequence 19 -> 7 -> 4 forms a natural line.
2.  **Left Connection:** From 4, the nearest logical connection inwards is to 16. From 16, we move up to 22.
3.  **Top Loop:** From 22, we traverse the top arc: 22 -> 10 -> 17 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6.
4.  **Right Descent:** From 6, we go down the right edge: 6 -> 11 -> 8 -> 15 -> 3.
5.  **Bottom-Right Hook:** From 3, there is a gap to the bottom-right cluster. The optimal path sweeps through the corner: 3 -> 9 -> 13 -> 18.
6.  **Middle Internal Sweep:** From 18, we move inwards to 14, then traverse the middle line leftwards: 14 -> 12 -> 21 -> 23 -> 24.
7.  **Bottom Return:** From 24, we drop down to 20, then sweep left along the bottom edge: 20 -> 25 -> 1.
8.  **Closing the Loop:** Finally, 1 connects back to 19 (the long straight edge along the bottom boundary).

Let's refine the order to ensure smooth transitions:
- Start at **19**.
- **19 -> 1 -> 25 -> 20**: Sweeps the bottom edge rightwards.
- **20 -> 24 -> 23 -> 21 -> 12 -> 14**: Moves up and traverses the center line rightwards.
- **14 -> 18 -> 13 -> 9 -> 3**: Drops to the bottom-right and hooks up to the right edge.
- **3 -> 15 -> 8 -> 11 -> 6**: Climbs the right edge.
- **6 -> 5 -> 2 -> 17 -> 10 -> 22**: Sweeps the top arc leftwards.
- **22 -> 16 -> 4 -> 7 -> 19**: Drops down the left side and returns to start.

This path creates a coherent counter-clockwise(ish) loop with an internal zig-zag to capture the middle points efficiently without crossing lines.

**Final Path Sequence:**
19, 1, 25, 20, 24, 23, 21, 12, 14, 18, 13, 9, 3, 15, 8, 11, 6, 5, 2, 17, 10, 22, 16, 4, 7

19, 1, 25, 20, 24, 23, 21, 12, 14, 18, 13, 9, 3, 15, 8, 11, 6, 5, 2, 17, 10, 22, 16, 4, 7
