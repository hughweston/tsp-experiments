Based on an analysis of the point locations and spatial clustering, here is the shortest tour visiting all 25 points. The path follows a general counter-clockwise loop, handling local clusters efficiently (such as the dense center group and the left-side "C" shape).

The logical sequence of the tour is:
1.  Start at **1** (bottom of left cluster) and move to the bottom group.
2.  Traverse the bottom points: **7, 4, 15**.
3.  Move up towards the center: **24, 3**.
4.  Wind through the dense center cluster: **10, 16, 23, 14, 25**.
5.  Exit center to the right: **2**.
6.  Traverse the right-side cluster, looping bottom-to-top: **19, 12, 20, 8, 18**.
7.  Jump up to the top-right group: **17, 5, 21**.
8.  Move left across the top: **13, 9**.
9.  Descend into the top-left cluster: **22, 6, 11**.
10. Close the loop back to **1**.

1, 7, 4, 15, 24, 3, 10, 16, 23, 14, 25, 2, 19, 12, 20, 8, 18, 17, 5, 21, 13, 9, 22, 6, 11
