To find the shortest tour visiting all 30 points, I will trace a path that generally follows the outer boundary of the points (the convex hull) while weaving inwards to visit the internal points in a logical cluster-by-cluster manner to minimize travel distance.

**Visual Analysis & Path Strategy:**
1.  **Top/Left Section:** The points 24, 18, and 13 form the top edge. Point 4 and 30 are on the far left. A logical sequence here is moving from the top-right towards the left and down: `29 -> 13 -> 18 -> 24 -> 4 -> 30`.
2.  **Bottom-Left Section:** From 30, the nearest neighbors are 19 and 6. Following the bottom curve: `30 -> 19 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8`.
3.  **Center-Left Cluster:** From 8, we move into the central cluster. `15` is the gateway. Moving up the spine: `8 -> 15 -> 16 -> 23 -> 7 -> 14`.
4.  **Center-Right Transition:** From 14, `5` is the closest point to the right. From 5, we can jump to `2`. `14 -> 5 -> 2`.
5.  **Right/Bottom-Right Cluster:** From 2, we sweep down the dense right-hand side. `2 -> 27 -> 20 -> 26 -> 25`. Note: 26 and 25 are slightly to the left, so we grab them before heading to the bottom corner.
6.  **Bottom-Right Loop:** From 25, we go to the bottommost points. `25 -> 10 -> 22 -> 12 -> 28`.
7.  **Far Right Edge:** Now moving up the far right edge back towards the start. `28 -> 17 -> 21 -> 11 -> 9 -> 1`.
8.  **Closing the Loop:** From 1, the nearest unvisited neighbor is 29 (our start of the top section), completing the cycle.

**Refining the Sequence:**
Let's assemble the path starting from point 1 for a canonical representation, following the counter-clockwise flow derived above:
*   Start at **1** (Top Right).
*   Go to **29** (Top Right Corner).
*   Go to **13** (Top Center).
*   Go to **18** (Top Left).
*   Go to **24** (Top Left).
*   Go to **4** (Left).
*   Go to **30** (Far Left).
*   Go to **19** (Left Down).
*   Go to **6** (Bottom Left).
*   Go to **3** (Bottom Left).
*   Go to **8** (Bottom Center-Left).
*   Go to **15** (Center).
*   Go to **16** (Center).
*   Go to **23** (Center Left).
*   Go to **7** (Center).
*   Go to **14** (Center).
*   Go to **5** (Center Top).
*   Go to **2** (Right Top).
*   Go to **27** (Right Middle).
*   Go to **20** (Right Middle).
*   Go to **26** (Center Right).
*   Go to **25** (Center Right).
*   Go to **10** (Bottom Center).
*   Go to **22** (Bottom Right).
*   Go to **12** (Bottom Right).
*   Go to **28** (Bottom Right).
*   Go to **17** (Bottom Right).
*   Go to **21** (Far Right).
*   Go to **11** (Right).
*   Go to **9** (Right).
*   Return to 1.

**Final Path Check:**
- All numbers 1-30 are present.
- No duplicates.
- The path follows a logical geometric progression minimizing large jumps.
