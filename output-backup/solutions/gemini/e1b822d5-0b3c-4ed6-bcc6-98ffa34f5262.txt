Based on the visual positions of the points, the optimal Traveling Salesman tour follows the perimeter of the points, dipping inwards to collect the central points in the most efficient manner to avoid crossing paths.

1.  **Left Cluster:** Points 4, 2, 8, 1, and 9 form a clear vertical chain on the left side. The order is **4-2-8-1-9** (or reverse).
2.  **Bottom Turn:** From point 9 (bottom-left), the nearest point to continue the loop is point **3** (bottom-center).
3.  **Middle Section:** From point 3, the tour must transition to the right side. Points 6 and 10 are in the middle. The most efficient path moves from 3 to **6**, then to **10**. This avoids long diagonal crossings later.
4.  **Right Cluster:** From point 10, the path goes to the adjacent point **7**, then up to point **5**.
5.  **Closing the Loop:** From point 5 (top-right), the path must return to the start of the left chain, point **4** (top-left). This is the longest segment but necessary to close the loop.

The sequence is: **1 -> 9 -> 3 -> 6 -> 10 -> 7 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1**.

1, 9, 3, 6, 10, 7, 5, 4, 2, 8
