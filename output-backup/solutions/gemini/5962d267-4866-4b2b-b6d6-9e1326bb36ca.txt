To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem with the given 15 points, we analyze the spatial distribution and potential connections.

1.  **Analyze Clusters and Hull:**
    *   **Left Edge:** Points 10, 13, 2 form a tight line on the left.
    *   **Top Left:** Points 15 and 7 are very close, with 15 being the top-most point.
    *   **Top Right:** Points 8, 11, 14 form an arc. Point 8 is the bridge to the left/center.
    *   **Right Edge:** Point 9 and 6 are on the far right descending.
    *   **Bottom:** Points 3 and 12 are at the bottom.
    *   **Center/Inner:** Points 5, 4, and 1 lie somewhat inside the convex hull formed by the others.

2.  **Determine Path Segments:**
    *   **Left Side:** The sequence **12 -> 10 -> 13 -> 2** is very strong. 12 and 10 are neighbors, and 10-13-2 is a nearly straight line of closest neighbors.
    *   **Top Transition:** From 2, the logical next step is **15** (top-left). From 15, the closest point is **7**. From 7, we move inward to **5**. From 5, the best bridge to the right side is **8**. This forms the segment **2 -> 15 -> 7 -> 5 -> 8**.
    *   **Right Side:** From 8, the path naturally follows the arc **8 -> 11 -> 14**. Then down to **9** and **6**.
    *   **Bottom Return:** From 6, the closest point to continue the loop is **3**.
    *   **Closing the Loop (Inner Points):** We have visited all points except **4** and **1**. We are at 3 and need to get back to the start of the left chain (12). The points 4 and 1 are located between 3 and 12.
        *   3 connects well to 4.
        *   4 is very close to 1.
        *   1 is very close to 12.
        *   This creates the efficient closing segment: **3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 12**.

3.  **Construct Full Tour:**
    Combining these segments:
    Start at **1** -> **12** -> **10** -> **13** -> **2** -> **15** -> **7** -> **5** -> **8** -> **11** -> **14** -> **9** -> **6** -> **3** -> **4** -> (back to 1).

4.  **Verification:**
    *   **1 -> 12 -> 10 -> 13 -> 2**: Follows the left boundary up.
    *   **2 -> 15 -> 7 -> 5 -> 8**: Jumps to top corner, dips to 7 and 5, then bridges to 8. This minimizes long edges compared to other orderings.
    *   **8 -> 11 -> 14 -> 9 -> 6**: Follows the right boundary down.
    *   **6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1**: Jumps left to bottom, then hooks up into the center (4, 1) to close at 12/1. This handles the inner points with minimal detour cost.
