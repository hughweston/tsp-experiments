Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour can be constructed by identifying local clusters and finding the most efficient bridges between them.

1.  **Cluster Analysis:**
    *   **Left Group:** Points 9, 7, 3. Point 9 is an outlier at the bottom-left.
    *   **Center Group:** Points 1, 2.
    *   **Top Group:** Points 10, 8.
    *   **Right Group:** Points 6, 4.
    *   **Bottom Group:** Point 5.

2.  **Path Construction:**
    *   Start at **1** (center).
    *   Move North to **2**, the closest neighbor.
    *   From 2, move West to **10**. This connects the center to the top-left.
    *   From 10, move East to **8**.
    *   From 8, continue East to **6**, the furthest right point.
    *   From 6, move South-West to **4**.
    *   From 4, move South-West to **5**.
    *   From 5, a long bridge is necessary to close the loop to the left side. The most efficient connection is to the outlier **9**.
    *   From 9, move North-East to **7**.
    *   From 7, move East to **3**.
    *   From 3, return to **1** to close the loop (distance 3-1 is very short).

3.  **Tour Verification:**
    *   Segment 1-2-10-8-6-4-5 follows the natural curve of the points from center to top-right to bottom.
    *   The jump 5-9 is the longest edge but avoids crossing other paths and connects the two ends of the "horseshoe" shape.
    *   Segment 9-7-3-1 efficiently handles the left-side points and returns to the start.

**Final Tour:**
1, 2, 10, 8, 6, 4, 5, 9, 7, 3
