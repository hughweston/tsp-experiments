Looking at this problem, I need to find the shortest tour connecting all 10 points.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Point 1: (410, 270)
- Point 2: (400, 190)
- Point 3: (290, 255)
- Point 4: (640, 385)
- Point 5: (580, 455)
- Point 6: (735, 155)
- Point 7: (150, 365)
- Point 8: (500, 95)
- Point 9: (40, 435)
- Point 10: (215, 75)

I'll analyze the layout:
- Left side: 9, 7
- Upper area: 10, 8, 6
- Center: 1, 2, 3
- Right side: 4, 5, 6

Starting with a tour and applying optimizations:

Initial tour attempt: 9→7→10→8→6→4→5→1→2→3→9
Calculating distances gives approximately 2065.

Applying 2-opt improvements:
Testing swap of edges (7,10) and (3,9):
New tour: 9→7→3→1→5→4→6→8→2→10→9

Calculating this tour:
- 9→7: 130
- 7→3: 178
- 3→1: 121
- 1→5: 251
- 5→4: 92
- 4→6: 249
- 6→8: 243
- 8→2: 138
- 2→10: 218
- 10→9: 400

Total ≈ 2020

After testing additional 2-opt swaps, no further improvements were found.
