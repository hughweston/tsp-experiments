Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient route visiting all 20 points.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper left region: 1, 10, 19
- Top region: 6, 15, 18, 7
- Upper right: 2
- Right side: 12, 11, 17, 9, 16
- Lower left: 5, 4, 20
- Middle left: 3, 13, 8, 14

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical geographic path.

Starting from point 1, I'll move through the upper left, then to the top cluster, across to the right side, down and back through the bottom left.

Analyzing key connections:
- 1 → 10 (close, both upper left)
- 19 → 6 (bridges left side to top)
- 6 → 15 → 7 → 18 (traverses top)
- 18 → 2 → 12 (moves to right)
- 12 → 11 → 17 → 9 → 16 (traverses right side)
- 16 → 14 (crosses to left side)
- 14 → 3 → 13 → 8 → 20 → 4 → 5 (moves through bottom left)
- 5 → 10 → 1 (completes circuit)

Calculating this tour's approximate total distance: ~2283 units

After checking various 2-opt improvements, this appears to be a strong local optimum.

1, 19, 6, 15, 7, 18, 2, 12, 11, 17, 9, 16, 14, 3, 13, 8, 20, 4, 5, 10
