Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 15 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper region: 6 (upper left), 9 (upper right), 5 (below 9)
- Right side: 8, 1, 14, 11
- Center: 12, 13, 2
- Left side: 15, 4, 7
- Lower region: 10, 3

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence.

Starting from the upper left and making a logical circuit:
- Begin at 6 (upper left)
- Go to 2 (center-left)
- Down to 7 (left side)
- To 15 (far left, upper)
- To 4 (far left, below 15)
- To 10 (lower left)
- To 3 (bottom center)
- To 13 (center)
- To 12 (center)
- To 11 (center-right)
- To 14 (lower right)
- To 1 (right side)
- To 8 (upper right side)
- To 5 (upper right)
- To 9 (top right)
- Return to 6

This creates an efficient loop around the perimeter with minimal crossing paths.

Let me verify key distances are reasonable:
- 15→4: Very close (nearly vertical)
- 4→10: Short distance
- 1→14: Very close (nearly vertical)
- 5→9: Close in upper right

6, 2, 7, 15, 4, 10, 3, 13, 12, 11, 14, 1, 8, 5, 9
