Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 15 points and find the shortest tour.

Let me estimate the coordinates:
- Point 1: (415, 218)
- Point 2: (470, 350)
- Point 3: (630, 365)
- Point 4: (30, 55)
- Point 5: (165, 65)
- Point 6: (445, 130)
- Point 7: (195, 130)
- Point 8: (20, 130)
- Point 9: (320, 80)
- Point 10: (530, 35)
- Point 11: (340, 218)
- Point 12: (95, 480)
- Point 13: (640, 65)
- Point 14: (265, 390)
- Point 15: (185, 265)

I'll analyze the point clusters:
- Top row: 4, 5, 9, 10, 13
- Upper middle: 8, 7, 6
- Center: 15, 11, 1
- Lower area: 14, 2, 3
- Bottom: 12

Building a tour that minimizes backtracking:
- Start at 4 (top-left), go to nearby 5, then 7
- Continue to 9, then down to 11, then to 1
- Go up-right to 6, then 10, then 13
- Come down right side: 3, then 2, then 14
- Down to 12, up to 15, then 8, back to 4

Calculating this tour distance:
4→5→7→9→11→1→6→10→13→3→2→14→12→15→8→4

This path avoids crossing and efficiently connects nearby points while handling the isolated point 12 optimally through 14 and 15.

4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 1, 6, 10, 13, 3, 2, 14, 12, 15, 8
