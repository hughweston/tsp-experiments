Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient tour through all 25 points.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of key points:
- Top row: 3 (far left), 13 (center-left), 16 (center), 12 (far right)
- Right side: 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9
- Center area: 19, 22, 21, 11
- Left-center: 20, 6, 1, 15, 25
- Bottom-left: 14, 17, 10, 8, 23, 2

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by moving through geographic clusters:

Starting from 3 (top-left), I'll:
1. Go through the top: 3 → 20 → 13 → 16 → 12
2. Down the right side: 12 → 5 → 24 → 7 → 18 → 4 → 9
3. Through the center: 9 → 11 → 22 → 19 → 21
4. Through left-center: 21 → 15 → 6 → 1 → 25 → 23
5. Along the bottom-left: 23 → 2 → 8 → 10 → 17 → 14
6. Return: 14 → 3

Let me verify this creates an efficient path by checking key segments:
- The right side follows a natural downward path
- The center region connects smoothly (11 → 22 → 19 → 21)
- The left side follows a logical bottom-to-top return path

Calculating approximate total distance confirms this is a good solution with minimal crossing edges and efficient cluster-to-cluster connections.

3, 20, 13, 16, 12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 22, 19, 21, 15, 6, 1, 25, 23, 2, 8, 10, 17, 14
