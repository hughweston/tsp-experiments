Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper left region: 5, 18, 6
- Upper middle: 10, 15
- Upper right region: 4, 16, 1, 13
- Middle left: 2, 3, 11
- Lower left: 12, 19
- Lower middle: 20, 7
- Middle right: 17
- Right side: 14
- Lower right: 8, 9

I'll construct a tour by connecting nearby clusters efficiently:

Starting from the upper region and working through clusters:
- Connect 5-18-10-15-4 (upper band)
- Move to 16-1-13 (upper right)
- Handle the isolated right cluster: 14-9-8
- Connect through middle: 17-7
- Visit lower left: 20-19-12-11-3
- Complete with 2-6 back to 5

After testing various configurations and optimizing connections:

Best path found:
- Start at 5, go through upper left (6), down to middle left (2,3,11)
- Visit lower left (12,19,20)
- Cross through middle (7,17)
- Handle right cluster (8,9,14)
- Return through upper middle (1,13,16,4,15,10,18)

Calculating distances for the optimized tour:
5→6→2→3→11→12→19→20→7→17→8→9→14→1→13→16→4→15→10→18→5

1, 13, 16, 4, 15, 10, 18, 5, 6, 2, 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 7, 17, 8, 9, 14
