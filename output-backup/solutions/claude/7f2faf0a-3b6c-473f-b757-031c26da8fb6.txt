Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient route through all 20 points.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point from the image:
- Upper left region: 14
- Upper middle: 18
- Upper right area: 10, 15, 7, 12, 19
- Middle region: 4, 11, 9, 17
- Left side: 20, 16
- Lower left: 3
- Lower middle: 5, 6, 1, 2
- Lower right: 8, 13

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical geographic path:

Starting from 14 (upper left), I'll go:
- Down the left side: 14 → 20 → 3
- Across the bottom: 3 → 5 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 8 → 13
- Up the right side: 13 → 12 → 15 → 7 → 10
- Through the middle: 10 → 19 → 18 → 4 → 11 → 17 → 9 → 16
- Back to start: 16 → 14

Let me verify this creates a reasonable path without excessive crossing:
- The route goes counterclockwise around the perimeter
- Middle points (4, 11, 17, 9) are handled efficiently in the interior

After checking several variations and applying local optimization:

14, 20, 3, 5, 6, 1, 2, 8, 13, 12, 15, 7, 10, 19, 18, 4, 11, 17, 9, 16
