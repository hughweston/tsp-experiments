Looking at the image, I need to identify point coordinates and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the point positions:
- Upper region: 26, 23, 8 (left); 28, 1, 21, 2 (right)
- Left side: 25, 30, 6, 7
- Middle: 22, 20, 5, 4
- Right side: 13, 17, 11, 9
- Bottom left: 27, 29, 24, 10, 16
- Bottom middle/right: 12, 3, 14, 18, 19, 15

I'll construct a tour by visiting nearby clusters efficiently:

Starting from point 27, going through the left side cluster (7, 6, 30, 25), then up to the upper left (26, 23, 8), through the middle (20, 5, 22, 4), across to the upper right (1, 28, 21, 2, 13, 17), down the right side (11, 9, 19, 15), through the bottom middle (18, 14, 3, 12), and finally the bottom left (16, 10, 29, 24) back to 27.

Verifying this creates logical connections:
- 27→7→6 follows left edge
- 30→25→26→23→8 traverses upper left
- 20→5→22→4→1 crosses middle to upper right
- 28→21→2→13→17 traces upper right
- 11→9→19→15 goes down right side
- 18→14→3→12→16 moves through bottom
- 10→29→24→27 completes the bottom left loop

27, 7, 6, 30, 25, 26, 23, 8, 20, 5, 22, 4, 1, 28, 21, 2, 13, 17, 11, 9, 19, 15, 18, 14, 3, 12, 16, 10, 29, 24
