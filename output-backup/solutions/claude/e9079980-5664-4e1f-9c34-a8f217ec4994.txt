Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient tour visiting all 20 points.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:
- Upper region: 18 (far left), 19 (center-left), 16 (right)
- Middle-left: 1, 4, 5
- Center: 6, 9
- Middle-right: 10, 14, 2, 17
- Lower-middle: 7, 8, 13
- Right side: 3, 15, 12
- Bottom: 11, 20

I'll construct a tour by connecting nearby points while avoiding long jumps:

Starting from 18 (top-left), I can go:
- 18 → 19 (nearby in top region)
- 19 → 4 → 5 (cluster in middle-left)
- 5 → 9 (central area)
- 9 → 6 → 10 → 16 (moving right and up)
- 16 → 14 → 2 → 17 (right side)
- 17 → 15 → 3 → 12 (moving down on right)
- 12 → 20 → 11 (bottom region)
- 11 → 13 → 8 → 7 (bottom-left cluster)
- 7 → 1 → 18 (back to start via left side)

Calculating key distances to verify this is efficient:
- 18→19: ~207, 19→4: ~120, 4→5: ~34, 5→9: ~90
- 9→6: ~133, 6→10: ~136, 10→16: ~61, 16→14: ~84
- 14→2: ~152, 2→17: ~30, 17→15: ~139, 15→3: ~35
- 3→12: ~27, 12→20: ~90, 20→11: ~115, 11→13: ~238
- 13→8: ~67, 8→7: ~57, 7→1: ~226, 1→18: ~160

This creates a logical flow without excessive backtracking.

18, 19, 4, 5, 9, 6, 10, 16, 14, 2, 17, 15, 3, 12, 20, 11, 13, 8, 7, 1
