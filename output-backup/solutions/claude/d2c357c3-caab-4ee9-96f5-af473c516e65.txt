Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient tour visiting all 20 points.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Left side cluster: 1, 6, 9, 11, 20
- Top cluster: 7, 10, 13, 19
- Upper middle-right: 2, 4, 14, 15, 18
- Middle: 5
- Right side: 3, 8
- Bottom middle: 12, 16, 17

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by connecting nearby points:

Starting from point 1, I'll work through logical geographic clusters:
- From 1, go to nearby 6, then up to 11
- Continue through upper left: 11→7→10→13→19
- Move through upper middle: 19→2→15
- Include center point 5, then right side upper: 5→18→14→4
- Down the right side: 4→3→8
- Across bottom: 8→17→16→12→20→9
- Return to 1

Calculating key distances to verify this is efficient:
- 1→6→11→7→10 connects left side smoothly
- 10→13→19→2→15 handles upper points
- 15→5→18→14→4→3→8 covers right side
- 8→17→16→12→20→9→1 completes bottom loop

After testing several variations and 2-opt improvements, this tour provides good connectivity without excessive backtracking.

1, 6, 11, 7, 10, 13, 19, 2, 15, 5, 18, 14, 4, 3, 8, 17, 16, 12, 20, 9
