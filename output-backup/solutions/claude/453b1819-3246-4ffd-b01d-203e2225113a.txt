Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper left area: 16, 21, 20
- Left side: 7, 11
- Top area: 23, 15, 14
- Upper right: 3, 17, 13, 18, 4
- Center: 9, 5, 12, 19
- Right center: 24
- Lower right: 6, 10, 2
- Lower left/center: 1, 22, 25, 8

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points consecutively:

Starting from the left side, going up, across the top, down the right side, and back through the center:
- Left side: 11 → 7 → 20 → 16 → 21
- Middle-left to top: 21 → 9 → 5 → 23
- Top area: 23 → 15 → 14 → 4
- Upper right: 4 → 3 → 17 → 13 → 18
- Down right side: 18 → 24 → 6 → 10 → 2
- Bottom and back through center: 2 → 8 → 12 → 19 → 22 → 25 → 1
- Close the loop: 1 → 11

Verifying all 25 points are included exactly once ✓

1, 11, 7, 20, 16, 21, 9, 5, 23, 15, 14, 4, 3, 17, 13, 18, 24, 6, 10, 2, 8, 12, 19, 22, 25
