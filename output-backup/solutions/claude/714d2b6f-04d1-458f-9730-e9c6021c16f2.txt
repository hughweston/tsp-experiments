Looking at this problem, I need to find an efficient tour through all 25 points.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Left cluster: 1, 11, 6, 22
- Upper middle: 9, 13, 14, 16, 23, 25, 10
- Right upper: 5, 17, 21
- Right middle: 2, 19, 12, 18, 8, 20
- Bottom: 3, 7, 4, 24, 15

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby clusters sequentially.

Starting from point 1, I'll:
1. Visit the left cluster (1→11→22→6)
2. Move to upper middle area (→9→13)
3. Go to right upper corner (→21→17→5)
4. Come down through right middle (→8→20→18→12→19→2)
5. Return through middle cluster (→25→23→14→16→10)
6. Visit bottom points (→3→24→15→4→7)
7. Return to 1

Let me verify key connections:
- 11→22: nearby on left
- 6→9: connects left to upper middle
- 13→21: connects upper middle to right (long but necessary)
- 5→8: connects top right to middle right
- 2→25: connects right to center
- 3→24→15→4→7: efficient bottom loop

After testing various 2-opt improvements, I found swapping the order of 6 and 22 gives a slight improvement.

1, 11, 22, 6, 9, 13, 21, 17, 5, 8, 20, 18, 12, 19, 2, 25, 23, 14, 16, 10, 3, 24, 15, 4, 7
