Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me map out the approximate positions:
- Top area: 14 (left), 11 (right), 6 (far left), 4 (right)
- Upper middle: 16, 13, 20
- Middle: 10 (left), 18, 8, 7 (right)
- Lower middle: 17, 9, 3, 1
- Bottom: 19, 5, 12, 15, 2

I'll construct a tour by connecting nearby clusters efficiently:

Starting from point 1, I'll travel:
- Right side upper: 1 → 7 → 4 → 11
- Cross to middle-upper: → 20 → 16 → 13
- Top left: → 14 → 6
- Left side down: → 10 → 18 → 17 → 19
- Bottom: → 5 → 12 → 9
- Return right: → 8 → 3 → 15 → 2 → back to 1

Calculating key distances to verify this is efficient:
- 1→7: ~62, 7→4: ~174, 4→11: ~83
- 11→20: ~154, 20→16: ~105, 16→13: ~83
- 13→14: ~209, 14→6: ~135
- 6→10: ~170, 10→18: ~174, 18→17: ~81
- 17→19: ~67, 19→5: ~147, 5→12: ~58
- 12→9: ~70, 9→8: ~152, 8→3: ~111
- 3→15: ~131, 15→2: ~187, 2→1: ~75

Total distance ≈ 2427

1, 7, 4, 11, 20, 16, 13, 14, 6, 10, 18, 17, 19, 5, 12, 9, 8, 3, 15, 2
