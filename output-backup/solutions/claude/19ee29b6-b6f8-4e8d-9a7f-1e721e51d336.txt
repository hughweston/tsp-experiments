Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient route through all 25 points.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Top area: 10 (far left), 2, 17, 5, 6 (far right)
- Upper right: 11, 8
- Right side: 15, 3
- Middle-right: 14, 21, 12
- Lower-right: 9, 13, 18
- Center: 23, 24, 20
- Left side: 22, 16, 4, 7
- Bottom-left: 19, 25, 1

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from 10 (top-left), I'll move through the left-upper area, across the top to the right side, down through the right side, through the center cluster, and back through the left side.

Route construction:
- 10 → 22 → 17 → 2 (upper left area)
- 2 → 5 → 6 (across top)
- 6 → 11 → 8 → 15 → 3 (down right side)
- 3 → 14 → 9 → 13 → 18 (right/lower right cluster)
- 18 → 12 → 21 → 20 → 23 → 24 (center cluster)
- 24 → 1 → 25 → 19 → 7 → 4 → 16 (bottom and left side)
- 16 → 10 (return)

Verifying all 25 points are included: 10, 22, 17, 2, 5, 6, 11, 8, 15, 3, 14, 9, 13, 18, 12, 21, 20, 23, 24, 1, 25, 19, 7, 4, 16 ✓

10, 22, 17, 2, 5, 6, 11, 8, 15, 3, 14, 9, 13, 18, 12, 21, 20, 23, 24, 1, 25, 19, 7, 4, 16
