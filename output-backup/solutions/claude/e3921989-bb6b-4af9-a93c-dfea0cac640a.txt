Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

Let me map out the approximate positions:
- Top row: 17 (far left), 5 (left-center), 8/19 (center), 7 (far right)
- Upper-middle: 3, 15 (left), 11 (center), 14 (right-center), 1 (center-right)
- Middle-right: 10, 9, 4
- Lower section: 12, 13 (left), 2, 20, 16 (center), 18, 6 (center-right)

I'll construct a tour by following a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 12, I'll work through the left side, then top, then right side, then bottom:

1. Start at 12 (bottom-left area)
2. Go up to 3, then 17 (top-left)
3. Continue along top: 15 → 5 → 19 → 8
4. Move through middle: 11 → 1 → 14
5. Go to top-right corner: 7
6. Down the right side: 10 → 9 → 4
7. Through middle-right: 6 → 18
8. Along bottom: 16 → 20 → 2
9. Back to left: 13 → return to 12

Verifying this creates a roughly circular path without excessive crossing.

12, 3, 17, 15, 5, 19, 8, 11, 1, 14, 7, 10, 9, 4, 6, 18, 16, 20, 2, 13
