Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 15 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper right area: 5, 9, 2
- Right side: 14, 6, 11, 7
- Left cluster: 8, 10, 3, 15, 12
- Bottom center: 13, 1, 4

I'll work on connecting these clusters efficiently while minimizing long jumps.

Starting from point 5, I'll trace a path:
- From 5, connecting to 14 (nearby in upper-right area)
- Then to 6, 11, 7 (traversing the right side)
- Down to the bottom cluster: 4, 1, 13
- Into the left cluster: 12, 3, 15, 10, 8 (arranged to minimize backtracking)
- Then to 9, 2 (upper area)
- Back to 5

Calculating key distances for this route:
- 5→14: ~243
- 14→6: ~163
- 6→11: ~142
- 11→7: ~130
- 7→4: ~346
- 4→1: ~25
- 1→13: ~38
- 13→12: ~132
- 12→3: ~36
- 3→15: ~63
- 15→10: ~40
- 10→8: ~113
- 8→9: ~418
- 9→2: ~50
- 2→5: ~215

Total estimated distance: ~2154

After checking various 2-opt swaps and alternative orderings, this tour appears optimal.

5, 14, 6, 11, 7, 4, 1, 13, 12, 3, 15, 10, 8, 9, 2
