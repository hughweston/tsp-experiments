Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 30 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me map out the approximate positions:
- Bottom left: 1, 28
- Left side: 15, 16, 24, 25
- Top left: 7, 27
- Top: 8, 19
- Upper middle: 4, 11
- Top right area: 30, 21, 20, 22
- Right side: 2, 5, 17, 23
- Bottom right: 29, 10
- Middle: 3, 9, 18, 26
- Lower middle: 6, 12, 13, 14

I'll construct a tour by following a logical path around the perimeter and through interior points:

Starting from 1 (bottom left):
- Go up the left side: 1→28→24→16→15
- Jump to top left: 15→7→27→8→19
- Cross upper area: 19→4→11→22→30→21→20
- Down right side: 20→2→5→17→23→29
- Through middle-right: 29→10→3→9
- Back through lower middle: 9→14→13→6→12
- Return via middle: 12→26→18→25→1

Verifying this visits all 30 points exactly once and forms a cycle.

1, 28, 24, 16, 15, 7, 27, 8, 19, 4, 11, 22, 30, 21, 20, 2, 5, 17, 23, 29, 10, 3, 9, 14, 13, 6, 12, 26, 18, 25
