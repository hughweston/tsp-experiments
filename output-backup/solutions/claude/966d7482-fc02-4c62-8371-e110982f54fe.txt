Looking at this TSP problem, I need to analyze the positions of all 25 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me identify the approximate coordinates and group points by region:
- Left side: 22, 23, 24, 5, 9, 15
- Center-left: 12, 19, 21, 8, 18
- Top: 25, 4, 10, 11, 17
- Center: 1, 13, 2, 7
- Right side: 3, 16, 20, 6, 14

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by moving through connected regions:

Starting from point 1, I'll trace through the top region, then down the right side, across the bottom, up the left side, and back through the interior:

**Tour construction:**
1 → 4 → 25 → 12 (top-left cluster)
→ 19 → 21 → 8 (interior, moving left)
→ 18 → 5 → 22 → 23 → 24 → 15 (left side, going down)
→ 9 → 7 (bottom-center)
→ 2 → 13 → 3 → 16 (center, moving right)
→ 14 → 6 → 20 → 17 (right side, going up)
→ 11 → 10 (top-right, returning to 1)

Verifying all 25 points are included exactly once: ✓

Calculating key segments to verify efficiency:
- The tour forms a rough loop without major crossings
- Left side cluster (5, 22, 23, 24, 15, 9) is traversed efficiently
- Right side (14, 6, 20, 17, 11, 10) follows a logical path

1, 4, 25, 12, 19, 21, 8, 18, 5, 22, 23, 24, 15, 9, 7, 2, 13, 3, 16, 14, 6, 20, 17, 11, 10
