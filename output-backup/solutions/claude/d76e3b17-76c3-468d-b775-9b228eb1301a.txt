Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 15 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me map out the approximate positions:
- Left cluster: 8 (top-left), 15 (left), 14 (upper-left), 4 (left), 6 (mid-left), 3 (lower-left), 5 (bottom)
- Right cluster: 11 (top-right), 9 (upper-right), 1 (right), 2 (right), 7 (mid-right), 13 (mid-right), 10 (center-right), 12 (lower-right)

I'll use a strategy of connecting the left and right clusters efficiently.

**Analyzing key connections:**
- Top bridge (left to right): 14→9 appears shortest
- Bottom bridge (right to left): 12→5 or 10→5

**Constructing the tour:**
Starting from 8, going through left side points, crossing to right cluster, then returning:

Route: 8 → 14 → 9 → 11 → 1 → 2 → 7 → 13 → 10 → 12 → 5 → 3 → 6 → 4 → 15 → back to 8

Verifying this visits all 15 points exactly once and forms a logical path that minimizes backtracking by:
- Efficiently traversing the upper portion (8→14→9→11→1→2→7→13)
- Moving down the right side (10→12)
- Crossing bottom (12→5)
- Returning up the left side (5→3→6→4→15→8)

8, 14, 9, 11, 1, 2, 7, 13, 10, 12, 5, 3, 6, 4, 15
