Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

Let me map out the approximate positions:
- Upper region: 4 (upper left), 1 (upper middle), 9 (upper right)
- Middle region: 3 (left), 8 (center), 2 (right)
- Lower right cluster: 7, 10, 11
- Lower left cluster: 5, 14, 12, 15
- Lower middle: 6, 13

I'll use a nearest neighbor approach combined with optimization to find a good tour.

Starting analysis:
- Points 7, 10, 11 form a tight cluster in the lower right
- Points 5, 12, 14, 15 cluster in the lower left
- Point 9 is isolated in the upper right (needs efficient connection)

Building the tour:
1. Connect upper points: 4 → 1 → 9
2. Travel through lower right cluster: 9 → 7 → 10 → 11
3. Bridge through middle: 11 → 2 → 8
4. Continue to lower area: 8 → 13 → 15 → 12
5. Through left cluster: 12 → 5 → 14 → 6 → 3
6. Return: 3 → 4

Calculating key distances to verify:
- 4-1: ~295
- 1-9: ~269
- 9-7: ~227
- 7-10-11: ~107 (short cluster edges)
- 11-2-8: ~315
- 8-13: ~265
- 13-15-12-5-14: ~390 (efficient left cluster traversal)
- 14-6-3-4: ~420

Total distance ≈ 2340
