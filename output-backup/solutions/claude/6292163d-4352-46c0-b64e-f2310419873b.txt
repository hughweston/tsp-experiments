Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Top area: 2 (far left), 9 (center-right)
- Upper-middle: 6 (left), 19 (center), 8 (center-left), 4 (right), 14 (far right)
- Middle: 18 (left), 16 (far left), 5 (center), 17, 11 (right), 13 (center-right)
- Lower area: 7 (center), 3 (center-right), 15 (right)
- Bottom: 20 (left), 10 (center-left), 12 (far left), 1 (center-right)

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical path:

Starting from point 1, I'll:
1. Visit the lower-center cluster (3, 7, 5)
2. Move to the left side (10, 20, 12, 16, 18)
3. Go up through 8, 6 to 2 (top-left)
4. Cross to 9 (top-right)
5. Visit the right side cluster (19, 4, 17, 14, 11, 13, 15)
6. Return to 1

Calculating key distances to verify this path:
- 1→3→7→5: short connections in lower area
- 5→10→20→12→16→18: efficient left-side traversal
- 18→8→6→2: moving up the left side
- 2→9: connecting top corners
- 9→19→4→17→14→11→13→15: efficient right-side loop
- 15→1: closing the tour

This creates a roughly circular path without major crossings.

1, 3, 7, 5, 10, 20, 12, 16, 18, 8, 6, 2, 9, 19, 4, 17, 14, 11, 13, 15
