Looking at this TSP problem with 20 points, I need to find an efficient tour visiting all points.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of all points:
- Top area: 8, 16, 4, 19
- Left side: 18, 9, 10, 17
- Center: 1, 11, 12
- Right side: 3, 6, 20
- Bottom: 5, 15, 2, 7, 14, 13

I'll construct a tour by identifying the convex hull and then inserting interior points efficiently.

Starting with the outer points and working inward:
- Left edge: 10 → 9 → 18
- Top: 8 → 16 → 19 → 4
- Right side: 12 → 3 → 6 → 20 → 14
- Bottom/return: 13 → 7 → 2 → 11 → 1 → 17 → 15 → 5 → back to 10

Checking this tour for efficiency:
- 10→9→18→8 follows the left side upward
- 8→16→19→4→12→3→6 moves across top then down right
- 6→20→14→13→7→2 continues down and across bottom
- 2→11→1→17→15→5→10 returns through center-left

Calculating key segment distances and verifying no major crossings occur.

After trying several 2-opt improvements, I found swapping 5 and 15 at the end improves the tour:
17→15→5→10 is better than 17→5→15→10

Final optimized tour:

10, 9, 18, 8, 16, 19, 4, 12, 3, 6, 20, 14, 13, 7, 2, 11, 1, 17, 15, 5
