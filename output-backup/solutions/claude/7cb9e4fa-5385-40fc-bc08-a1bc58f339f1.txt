Looking at this TSP problem with 15 points, I need to find the shortest tour visiting all points exactly once.

Let me identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Upper region: 5, 6, 14
- Left side: 3, 11, 7, 10
- Center-left: 1
- Lower-middle: 2
- Center: 4
- Right side: 8, 9, 12, 13, 15

I'll analyze the clusters and find efficient connections:

**Left cluster** (10, 7, 11, 3, 1, 14, 5, 6, 2): Points are relatively close together
**Right cluster** (4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15): Points on the right side

Key observations:
- 10-7, 7-11, 11-3 form a natural chain on the left
- 5-14, 5-6 are short edges in the upper area
- 9-12, 8-13, 13-15 are short edges on the right
- Need to connect clusters efficiently

Testing a tour that follows a logical geographic path:

**Tour: 10 → 7 → 11 → 3 → 1 → 14 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 8 → 15 → 13 → 4 → 2 → 10**

Calculating distances:
- Left side: 10→7→11→3→1→14→5→6 (short consecutive edges)
- Bridge to right: 6→9 (necessary long jump)
- Right side: 9→12→8→15→13 (efficient path)
- Bridge back: 13→4→2→10 (good connections)

This tour minimizes backtracking and uses the shortest available bridges between the two main clusters.

10, 7, 11, 3, 1, 14, 5, 6, 9, 12, 8, 15, 13, 4, 2
