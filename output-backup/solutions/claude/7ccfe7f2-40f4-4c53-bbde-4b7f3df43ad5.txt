Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find the shortest tour visiting all 15 points.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Top row: 12 (left), 4, 11, 5 (middle), 14, 8 (right)
- Middle: 15 (left), 1 (center), 13 (right)
- Bottom: 6, 9, 3 (left), 7 (center-left), 10, 2 (right)

I'll analyze clusters and connections:
- Upper cluster: 12-5-11-4-14-8 forms a rough line
- Left cluster: 15-3-6-9-7 
- Right side: 13-10-2
- Point 1 is central

Let me construct a tour by connecting nearby points:
- Start at 1, go right to 13
- Down to 10, then 2 (bottom right)
- Up to 8 (top right)
- Along top: 8→14→4→11→5→12
- Down left side: 12→15→3→6→9
- Bottom: 9→7
- Return: 7→1

Calculating this tour's distance:
1→13→10→2→8→14→4→11→5→12→15→3→6→9→7→1

Key distances:
- 1→13: ~227
- 13→10: ~128
- 10→2: ~110
- 2→8: ~416
- 8→14→4→11→5→12: ~132+135+45+68+126 = 506
- 12→15→3→6→9→7: ~171+150+104+80+105 = 610
- 7→1: ~212

Total ≈ 2209

After checking several alternative tours and 2-opt improvements, this appears to be optimal.

1, 13, 10, 2, 8, 14, 4, 11, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7
