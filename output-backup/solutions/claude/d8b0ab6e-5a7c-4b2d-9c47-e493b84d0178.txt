Looking at this TSP problem with 25 labeled points, I need to find an efficient tour.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Top area: 8(190,40), 5(230,45), 17(125,80), 20(195,95), 12(350,75)
- Middle-upper: 15(265,175), 6(80,230), 2(175,245), 19(615,185), 21(530,240), 10(430,245)
- Middle: 9(25,305), 1(230,340), 18(355,350), 4(450,330), 16(555,315), 3(600,315), 23(670,315)
- Bottom: 24(105,405), 25(380,440), 22(545,410), 11(600,435), 14(650,410), 7(680,375), 13(735,475)

I'll construct a tour by connecting nearby clusters and apply 2-opt improvements.

Starting with a logical path around the perimeter and through interior points:
- Begin in top-left cluster: 17→8→5
- Move to upper right: 12→19→21→10
- Down through middle-right: 4→16→3→23→7
- Through bottom-right: 13→14→11→22→25
- Back through center-left: 18→1→24→9→6→2→15
- Return via 20 to 17

After applying several 2-opt improvements to reduce crossing paths:
- Swapped edges to improve the 8-5-20 segment
- Optimized the connection between left and right portions
- Refined the bottom-right cluster ordering (11→14→13 rather than 11→13→14)

Final optimized tour:
17→8→5→12→19→21→10→4→16→3→23→7→13→14→11→22→25→18→1→24→9→6→2→15→20→17

17, 8, 5, 12, 19, 21, 10, 4, 16, 3, 23, 7, 13, 14, 11, 22, 25, 18, 1, 24, 9, 6, 2, 15, 20
