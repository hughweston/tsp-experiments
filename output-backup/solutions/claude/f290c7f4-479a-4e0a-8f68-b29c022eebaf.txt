Looking at this TSP problem with 15 points, I need to find an efficient tour.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Top region: 10, 6, 11, 3
- Middle region: 7, 12, 15, 5
- Right side: 4, 8
- Left side: 14, 2
- Bottom region: 1, 9, 13

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby clusters:

Starting from point 3 (top left), I can move along the top: 3 → 10 → 6 → 11

Then descend to the right side: 11 → 4 → 8

Continue to the bottom right and across: 8 → 13 → 9 → 1

Move through the middle points: 1 → 5 → 7 → 12 → 15

Finally return via the left side: 15 → 2 → 14 → back to 3

Checking this tour:
- Top section flows smoothly: 3-10-6-11
- Right side cluster: 4-8
- Bottom sweep: 13-9-1
- Middle cluster: 5-7-12-15
- Left side return: 2-14

This creates a roughly circular path without major crossings.

3, 10, 6, 11, 4, 8, 13, 9, 1, 5, 7, 12, 15, 2, 14
