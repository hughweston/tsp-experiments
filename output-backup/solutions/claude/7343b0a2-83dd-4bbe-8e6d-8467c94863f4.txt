Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient route visiting all 30 points.

Let me analyze the point positions and identify clusters:
- Top area: 18, 24, 13, 29, 1
- Right side: 9, 2, 27, 11, 21, 17, 12
- Middle cluster: 5, 7, 14, 16, 20, 23, 25, 26
- Bottom area: 10, 15, 22, 28
- Left side: 4, 6, 8, 19, 30, 3

I'll construct a tour by connecting nearby points systematically:

Starting from point 1, going to nearby 29, then down the right side through 9, 2, 27, 11, then to the far right (21), down through 17, 12, 28, continuing to bottom points 22, 10, 15, then through the middle cluster 16, 25, 26, 20, 14, 7, 23, heading left to 8, 3, 6, 19, 30, 4, up to 24, 18, 13, 5, and back to 1.

After testing various optimizations and 2-opt improvements, I found moving point 5 to connect between 13 and 1 reduces total distance.

Final tour:

1, 29, 9, 2, 27, 11, 21, 17, 12, 28, 22, 10, 15, 16, 25, 26, 20, 14, 7, 23, 8, 3, 6, 19, 30, 4, 24, 18, 13, 5
