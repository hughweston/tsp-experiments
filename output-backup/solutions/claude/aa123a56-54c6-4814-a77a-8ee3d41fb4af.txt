Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the coordinates:
- Point 1: (500, 295), Point 2: (150, 155), Point 3: (590, 250)
- Point 4: (540, 175), Point 5: (245, 120), Point 6: (735, 375)
- Point 7: (520, 320), Point 8: (745, 205), Point 9: (150, 75)
- Point 10: (255, 45), Point 11: (560, 105), Point 12: (460, 320)
- Point 13: (645, 220), Point 14: (735, 65), Point 15: (665, 385)
- Point 16: (130, 440), Point 17: (40, 130), Point 18: (720, 420)
- Point 19: (295, 120), Point 20: (725, 135)

I'll construct a tour by analyzing the spatial layout:
- Left side cluster: 16, 17, 2, 9
- Upper left: 10, 5, 19
- Upper right: 11, 4, 14, 20
- Right side: 8, 13
- Lower right: 6, 18, 15
- Center: 1, 3, 7, 12

Building a tour that minimizes backtracking:
- Start at 16 (bottom left) → 17 → 2 → 9 → 10 (going up left side)
- Continue: 5 → 19 → 4 → 11 → 14 → 20 → 8 (sweep right side top to bottom)
- Then: 6 → 18 → 15 (lower right cluster)
- Connect through center: 13 → 3 → 7 → 1 → 12 → back to 16

Verifying key connections are efficient:
- 19→4: connects upper middle to right side
- 8→6: connects to lower right
- 13→3→7: efficient path through center
- 12→16: completes the loop

16, 17, 2, 9, 10, 5, 19, 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3, 7, 1, 12
