Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find the shortest tour visiting all 15 points.

Let me identify the point positions:
- Left cluster: 2, 8, 11, 1, 6
- Top-right area: 3, 5, 7, 12, 14
- Right side: 9
- Center-bottom: 10, 13, 15
- Bottom-right: 4

I'll work on connecting these clusters efficiently.

**Left cluster internal path:** Following 2→8→11 (upper) and 1→6 (lower) connected by short edges.

**Bridge from left to right:** Point 11 can connect to 5 (both in upper region).

**Right side traversal:** From 5→7→3→12→14→9 follows the upper right region naturally.

**Bottom portion:** 9→4→15→13→10 handles the right side going down and across the middle-bottom.

**Return bridge:** 10→6 connects back to the left cluster.

Calculating the tour: 1→2→8→11→5→7→3→12→14→9→4→15→13→10→6→1

Verifying key distances:
- 1-2: ~105, 2-8: ~101, 8-11: ~123
- 11-5: ~333 (necessary bridge)
- 5-7: ~79, 7-3: ~138, 3-12: ~85, 12-14: ~66, 14-9: ~75
- 9-4: ~228, 4-15: ~170, 15-13: ~90, 13-10: ~55
- 10-6: ~268 (return bridge)
- 6-1: ~52

Total: approximately 1969

1, 2, 8, 11, 5, 7, 3, 12, 14, 9, 4, 15, 13, 10, 6
