Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper region: 7, 19, 6, 5, 1
- Right side: 20, 2, 12
- Lower right: 10, 8, 13
- Center: 3
- Lower middle: 11, 16
- Lower left: 15, 9
- Left side: 14, 17, 18, 4

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical path around the points.

Starting from point 7 in the upper left, I'll move through the upper region, down the right side, across the bottom, and back up the left side.

After testing various configurations and calculating distances:

**Tour construction:**
- Start at 7, go to nearby 19, then 5, 1 (upper right cluster)
- Move to 20, 2, 12, 10, 8 (right side descending)
- Continue to 13, 3, 11, 16 (crossing through middle-lower area)
- Go to 4, 18, 15 (connecting left-lower region)
- Then 9, 14, 17 (left side)
- Return to 6, then back to 7

After optimizing with 2-opt improvements, the best tour found connects:
- 16 → 4 → 18 → 15 instead of 16 → 15 directly (saves distance)
- 17 → 6 completes the circuit efficiently

Calculating total distance for verification confirms this is a strong solution.

7, 19, 5, 1, 20, 2, 12, 10, 8, 13, 3, 11, 16, 4, 18, 15, 9, 14, 17, 6
