Looking at this problem, I need to find an efficient route connecting all 15 points.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Point 1: (595, 435) - bottom right
- Point 2: (425, 355) - center
- Point 3: (340, 265) - center-left
- Point 4: (345, 355) - center-left
- Point 5: (220, 205) - left
- Point 6: (355, 45) - top center
- Point 7: (100, 435) - bottom left
- Point 8: (540, 240) - right
- Point 9: (640, 205) - far right
- Point 10: (460, 295) - center-right
- Point 11: (105, 135) - upper left
- Point 12: (310, 95) - top
- Point 13: (345, 295) - center
- Point 14: (415, 385) - center-lower
- Point 15: (245, 80) - top left

I'll identify clusters and build a tour:
- Left side: 7, 5, 11
- Top: 15, 12, 6
- Right side: 8, 9, 1
- Center: 10, 2, 14, 4, 13, 3

Building a tour that connects these clusters efficiently:
- Start at 7 (bottom left) → 5 → 11 (going up left side)
- Continue: 11 → 15 → 12 → 6 (across top)
- Then: 6 → 8 → 9 → 1 (right side, going down)
- Return through center: 1 → 10 → 2 → 14 → 4 → 13 → 3 → back to 7

Calculating key distances to verify this is efficient:
- 7→5→11 is shorter than 7→11→5
- 6→8→9 avoids the longer 6→9 direct path
- The center cluster order 10→2→14→4→13→3 minimizes backtracking

Total estimated distance ≈ 2044 units

7, 5, 11, 15, 12, 6, 8, 9, 1, 10, 2, 14, 4, 13, 3
