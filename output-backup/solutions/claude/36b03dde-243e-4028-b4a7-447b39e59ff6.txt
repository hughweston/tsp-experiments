Looking at the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Top cluster: 7 (top-left), 1 (slightly right), 3 (middle-top), 2 (upper-right)
- Left side: 8 (middle-left), 6 (bottom-left)
- Middle-bottom: 4
- Right side: 9 (middle-right), 10 (right), 5 (bottom-right)

I need to find an efficient tour that minimizes backtracking and long diagonal jumps.

**Strategy:** Start from the top-left, traverse the top cluster, go down the right side, cross to the bottom-left, then return up the left side.

**Analyzing the tour:** 7 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 6 → 8 → 7

Calculating approximate distances:
- 7→1: ~62
- 1→3: ~70
- 3→2: ~95
- 2→9: ~180 (straight down)
- 9→10: ~255
- 10→5: ~170
- 5→4: ~355 (crossing to left)
- 4→6: ~215
- 6→8: ~275
- 8→7: ~170

Total: ~1847

I verified alternative routes (like going through 9→4 first, or different orderings) and they resulted in longer distances due to:
- The 2→10 direct path (~333) being longer than going through 9
- Alternative crossings creating longer paths
