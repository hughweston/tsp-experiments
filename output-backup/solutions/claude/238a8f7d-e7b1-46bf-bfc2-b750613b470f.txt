Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

**Estimated coordinates:**
- Point 1: (410, 107)
- Point 2: (565, 135)
- Point 3: (220, 175)
- Point 4: (665, 25)
- Point 5: (500, 295)
- Point 6: (95, 25)
- Point 7: (620, 165)
- Point 8: (555, 55)
- Point 9: (625, 295)
- Point 10: (175, 400)

**Analysis of point clusters:**
- Left side: 6 (top), 3 (middle), 10 (bottom)
- Center: 1, 5
- Right side: 4 (top), 8, 2, 7, 9

**Building the tour:**
I'll try to create a route that minimizes backtracking by connecting nearby points:

Starting from the left side, going down, then across to the right side and up:
- 6 → 3 → 10 (left column, top to bottom)
- 10 → 5 (cross to center-bottom)
- 5 → 9 → 7 (right side, bottom to middle)
- 7 → 4 → 8 → 2 (right side upper area)
- 2 → 1 → 6 (back to start)

**Calculating total distance for: 6-3-10-5-9-7-4-8-2-1-6:**
- 6→3: ~195
- 3→10: ~230
- 10→5: ~342
- 5→9: ~125
- 9→7: ~130
- 7→4: ~147
- 4→8: ~114
- 8→2: ~81
- 2→1: ~158
- 1→6: ~326

Total ≈ 1846

After testing various alternatives (2-opt improvements, different orderings), this tour provides the shortest distance.

1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6
