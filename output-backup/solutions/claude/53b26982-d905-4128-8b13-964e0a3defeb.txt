Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient tour through all 15 points.

Let me identify the point clusters:
- Upper left cluster: 1, 6, 10, 11
- Left side: 4, 7, 13
- Upper area: 9, 12
- Middle: 8
- Lower right: 3, 5, 14, 15, 2

I'll construct a tour by connecting these clusters efficiently.

Starting from point 6, I can trace through the upper left cluster (6→1→10→11), then to the upper area (→9→8→12), sweep through the right side (→3→5→14→15), then back through the bottom-left (→2→4→7→13) and return to 6.

Calculating key distances:
- 6→1→10→11→9: efficient chain through upper-left (~267)
- 9→8→12: connecting upper region (~388)
- 12→3→5→14→15: right side sweep (~813)
- 15→2→4→7→13→6: return path through left (~692)

Verifying the complete tour:
6→1→10→11→9→8→12→3→5→14→15→2→4→7→13→6

This visits all 15 points exactly once and creates reasonable connections between clusters.

1, 10, 11, 9, 8, 12, 3, 5, 14, 15, 2, 4, 7, 13, 6
