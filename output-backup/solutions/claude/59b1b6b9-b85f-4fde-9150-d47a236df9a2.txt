Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the positions:
- Point 1: center (~350, 295)
- Point 2: upper right area (~450, 150)
- Point 3: center-left (~230, 215)
- Point 4: upper middle (~325, 65)
- Point 5: lower center (~305, 460)
- Point 6: center-left (~265, 285)
- Point 7: lower left (~165, 480)
- Point 8: top right corner (~655, 20)
- Point 9: right side (~580, 325)
- Point 10: left side (~115, 175)

I'll analyze the structure:
- Point 8 is isolated in the top-right and must be connected efficiently
- Points 5, 7 are at the bottom
- Points 10, 3 are on the left
- Points 6, 1 are in the center

For point 8, the closest neighbors are 2 (~243) and 9 (~314), so connecting 9→8→2 is optimal.

Building a tour that minimizes backtracking:
- Start from left side: 10→3→6
- Go to bottom: →7→5
- Connect to center and right: →1→9
- Handle isolated point 8: →8→2
- Return via upper area: →4→10

Calculating this tour: 10→3→6→7→5→1→9→8→2→4→10
- Distances: ~124 + ~74 + ~219 + ~141 + ~171 + ~232 + ~314 + ~243 + ~151 + ~237 ≈ 1906

After checking various alternatives and 2-opt improvements, this appears to be the optimal solution.
