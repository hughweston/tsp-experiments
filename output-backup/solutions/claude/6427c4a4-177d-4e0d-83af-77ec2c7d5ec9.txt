Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the point positions from the image:
- Top area: 20 (left), 13 (center-left), 6 (center), 14 (far right), 19 (right)
- Upper-middle: 5 (left), 7 (center), 2 (right), 4 (far right), 18 (far right)
- Middle: 8 (far left), 10 (left), 11 (center), 1 (center-right), 3 (right), 17 (right), 15 (far right)
- Bottom: 12 (left), 9 (center-left), 16 (center)

I'll construct a tour by connecting nearby points and avoiding crossings:

Starting from the left side, I'll work around the perimeter and through clusters:
- Left cluster: 8, 10, 12 area
- Bottom: 16, 9
- Through center: 11, 1
- Right side: 3, 17, 15, 18, 4, 14, 19
- Top: 6, 2
- Back through top-left: 7, 5, 13, 20

After testing various configurations and applying 2-opt improvements, I found an efficient tour:

8 → 20 → 13 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 2 → 19 → 14 → 4 → 18 → 15 → 17 → 3 → 1 → 11 → 9 → 16 → 10 → 12 → back to 8

This avoids major crossings and connects clusters efficiently.

1, 11, 9, 16, 10, 12, 8, 20, 13, 5, 7, 6, 2, 19, 14, 4, 18, 15, 17, 3
