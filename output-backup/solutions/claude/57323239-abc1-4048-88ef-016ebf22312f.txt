Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 30 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Top area: 26, 30, 10 (left to right), with 12, 20, 9 below
- Upper-middle: 17, 14, 23, 15, 22, 16, 13
- Middle: 27, 1, 5, 8, 3, 24, 25
- Bottom: 29, 6, 18, 11, 4, 2, 19, 21, 28, 7

Strategy: Create a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby clusters sequentially.

Starting from point 17, I'll trace a path:
1. Go up the left side: 17→12→26
2. Cross to upper middle: →20→14→23→15
3. Go to top right via 30: →30→10→9
4. Down the right side: →22→16→13→3→24→25
5. To bottom right: →7→28→21→19
6. Sweep left along bottom: →2→4→11→18→6→29
7. Connect through remaining left points: →1→5→8→27
8. Return to start: →17

Verifying all 30 points are included exactly once:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 ✓

17, 12, 26, 20, 14, 23, 15, 30, 10, 9, 22, 16, 13, 3, 24, 25, 7, 28, 21, 19, 2, 4, 11, 18, 6, 29, 1, 5, 8, 27
