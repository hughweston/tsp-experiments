Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 30 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Left side cluster: 7, 14, 8, 29, 16, 20
- Bottom-left area: 30, 6, 12, 2
- Center-left: 27, 9
- Center: 22, 4, 23, 15
- Upper-middle: 13, 10
- Top-right area: 28, 24, 11
- Right side: 18, 1, 25, 26, 17
- Center-right: 3, 21, 5, 19

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following geographical clusters:

Starting from 20 (bottom-left), I'll move through the bottom region, then sweep through the middle and right side, and return via the left edge.

Analyzing connections:
- Bottom path: 20→30→6→12→2→9→27→22→4
- Through upper-middle: 4→13→10→28→24→11
- Down the right side: 11→18→1→25→26→17→3→21
- Middle-right area: 21→5→19→15→23
- Return via left side: 23→7→14→8→29→16→20

The key challenge is connecting point 7 (isolated top-left). After testing various configurations, connecting 23→7 then continuing 7→14→8→29→16 provides a reasonable path back.

Calculating critical distances:
- 23→7: ~420
- 7→14: ~63
- 14→8: ~66
- 8→29: ~64
- 29→16: ~81
- 16→20: ~86

This tour visits all points efficiently while minimizing long detours.

20, 30, 6, 12, 2, 9, 27, 22, 4, 13, 10, 28, 24, 11, 18, 1, 25, 26, 17, 3, 21, 5, 19, 15, 23, 7, 14, 8, 29, 16
