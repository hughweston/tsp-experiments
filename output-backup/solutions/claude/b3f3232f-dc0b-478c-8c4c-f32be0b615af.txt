Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 25 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Top region: 15 (far left), 18 (middle), 19, 3 (right), 21, 7 (far right)
- Upper-middle: 4, 10, 22, 5, 9
- Middle: 14 (left), 1 (right)
- Lower-middle: 25 (left), 2, 12, 24, 8, 13, 23, 20 (right)
- Bottom: 6, 16 (left), 11, 17 (right)

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical geographic path:

Starting from point 15 (top-left), I'll go down the left side, across the bottom-middle, up the right side, and back across the top:

1. Left side descent: 15 → 14 → 25 → 6 → 16
2. Middle region: → 12 → 2 → 24 → 8 → 13 → 11
3. Bottom-right: → 23 → 17 → 20
4. Right side ascent: → 1 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 21
5. Top region return: → 3 → 19 → 22 → 18 → 10 → 4 → 15

Verifying all 25 points are included exactly once: ✓

15, 14, 25, 6, 16, 12, 2, 24, 8, 13, 11, 23, 17, 20, 1, 9, 5, 7, 21, 3, 19, 22, 18, 10, 4
