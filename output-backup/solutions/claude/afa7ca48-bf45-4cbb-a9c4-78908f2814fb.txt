Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

**Analyzing point positions:**
- Left cluster: Points 2, 3, 4, 8 (bottom-left area)
- Center: Points 1, 6, 7
- Right cluster: Points 5, 9, 10

**Strategy:**
I'll connect nearby points and minimize long crossings between clusters.

**Building the tour:**

For the left cluster, the efficient path is: 4 → 8 → 3 → 2 (these points are relatively close)

For the right cluster: 9 → 5 → 10 (minimizing internal distances)

Connecting the clusters through center points:
- From left cluster point 2 to center point 7
- From center through 7 → 9 to reach right cluster
- From right cluster point 10 to center point 6
- From 6 → 1 → 4 to complete the cycle

**Calculating the tour:**
4 → 8 → 3 → 2 → 7 → 9 → 5 → 10 → 6 → 1 → (back to 4)

This creates a logical flow that:
- Efficiently traverses the left cluster
- Crosses to the right side via point 7
- Traverses the right cluster
- Returns via points 6 and 1

4, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 10, 6, 1
