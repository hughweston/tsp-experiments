Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

**Point Positions (approximate):**
- Point 1: bottom center-right
- Point 2: top center
- Point 3: left side, middle
- Point 4: upper right
- Point 5: bottom left
- Point 6: bottom right
- Point 7: top area (between 9 and 2)
- Point 8: top left
- Point 9: top left (between 8 and 7)
- Point 10: right side, middle

**Strategy:**
I'll identify clusters and find a path that minimizes backtracking:
- Top cluster: 8, 9, 7, 2
- Left side: 3, 5
- Right side: 4, 10, 6
- Bottom: 5, 1, 6

**Building the tour:**
Starting from bottom left (5), I'll move up the left side, across the top, down the right side, and back:
- 5 → 3 (nearby on left)
- 3 → 8 (move up to top left)
- 8 → 9 → 7 → 2 (traverse top from left to right)
- 2 → 4 (continue to upper right)
- 4 → 10 (down right side)
- 10 → 6 (continue down to bottom right)
- 6 → 1 (along bottom)
- 1 → 5 (return to start)

**Verification:**
This creates a roughly circular tour with no major crossings, efficiently connecting nearby points in sequence.

1, 6, 10, 4, 2, 7, 9, 8, 3, 5
