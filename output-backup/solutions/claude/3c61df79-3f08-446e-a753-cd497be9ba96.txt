Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find a tour visiting all 25 points efficiently.

Let me identify the approximate coordinates of each point and analyze the layout:
- Far left: Point 1
- Upper left region: Points 21, 3, 25
- Upper right: Points 20, 12
- Middle band: Points 4, 16, 2, 6, 8, 15, 5, 10
- Center: Points 19, 22
- Lower middle: Points 17, 13, 24
- Lower left: Points 18, 7
- Lower right: Points 9, 14, 11, 23

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by:
1. Starting from point 1 on the far left
2. Moving through the left-center region
3. Going down through the lower left area
4. Moving across to the center and lower right
5. Going up the right side to visit 12 and 20
6. Coming back through the upper portion to return to start

Calculating key distances to optimize the route, I'll avoid long jumps by keeping nearby points together:

Tour construction:
- Start: 1 → 4 (nearby, left side)
- Continue: → 2 → 19 → 17 (down through left-center)
- Lower left: → 18 → 7 → 13 (bottom left region)
- Center: → 22 → 24 → 9 → 14 → 23 → 11 (moving right along lower section)
- Right side up: → 10 → 12 → 20 (visiting upper right peninsula)
- Back through middle: → 6 → 8 → 15 → 5 (middle right band)
- Upper left completion: → 16 → 25 → 3 → 21 → back to 1

This creates an efficient loop without major crossing paths.

1, 4, 2, 19, 17, 18, 7, 13, 22, 24, 9, 14, 23, 11, 10, 12, 20, 6, 8, 15, 5, 16, 25, 3, 21
