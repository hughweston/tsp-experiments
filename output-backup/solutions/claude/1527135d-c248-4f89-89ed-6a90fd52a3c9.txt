Looking at this TSP problem, I need to analyze the point positions and find an efficient tour.

Let me identify the key clusters:
- Top left: 25, 5
- Top center-right: 22, 4, 23, 8
- Middle left: 15, 1, 14, 24
- Center: 16, 10, 18, 13, 17, 2
- Right side: 21, 11, 7, 9
- Bottom: 20, 12, 6, 3

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from 25 (isolated top-left), go to nearby 5, then across the top through 22, down through 16 and 10, continue to 4, 23, 8 (top right), then down the right side through 7, 11, 9, then to 3 at bottom right, across through 6, 12, 20, then handle the middle section with 19, 21, 2, 17, 13, 18, and return through 1, 14, 24, 15 back to 25.

Calculating key segments to verify this creates an efficient path:
- 25→5→22→16→10→4→23→8 (follows top edge)
- 8→7→11→9→3→6→12→20 (right side down and across bottom)
- 20→19→21→2→17→13→18→1→14→24→15→25 (middle points and return)

This creates a roughly circular tour without major crossings.

25, 5, 22, 16, 10, 4, 23, 8, 7, 11, 9, 3, 6, 12, 20, 19, 21, 2, 17, 13, 18, 1, 14, 24, 15
