Looking at this TSP instance with 30 points, I need to find an efficient tour that visits all points exactly once.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper left cluster: 23, 16, 27, 10, 22
- Left side: 19, 15, 14, 20
- Lower left: 6, 12
- Upper middle: 30, 3, 13
- Upper right: 28, 2
- Middle: 9, 17, 18
- Right side: 5, 21, 11, 7, 25, 29
- Lower middle/right: 24, 1, 4, 8, 26

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence:

Starting from 23 (top-left), I'll sweep through the left side, then work through the middle and right portions:

1. Start at 23, go to nearby 10, then 22
2. Continue down left side: 19 → 20 → 14 → 15
3. Drop to bottom left: 6 → 12 → 8
4. Move through middle: 17 → 24 → 1
5. Handle right cluster: 7 → 25 → 4 → 26 → 29 → 11 → 21 → 5
6. Upper right: 18 → 2 → 28 → 9
7. Return via upper middle: 13 → 3 → 30 → 27 → 16 → back to 23

Verifying the tour visits all 30 points exactly once and calculating approximate distances shows this creates an efficient path.

23, 10, 22, 19, 20, 14, 15, 6, 12, 8, 17, 24, 1, 7, 25, 4, 26, 29, 11, 21, 5, 18, 2, 28, 9, 13, 3, 30, 27, 16
