Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient route visiting all 25 points.

Let me identify the approximate positions of points:
- Top area: 2, 20, 4, 6, 8
- Right side: 10, 14, 17, 25
- Center: 3, 9, 22
- Bottom right: 16, 21, 12, 1
- Bottom center: 18, 13, 19
- Left side: 5, 7, 11, 15, 23, 24

I'll construct a tour that moves efficiently through these regions:

Starting from top-left (2), moving across the top, down the right side, through the bottom, up the left side, and back through the center.

**Route construction:**
- Top: 2 → 20 → 6 → 4 → 8
- Right side down: → 10 → 17 → 25 → 14
- Through center-right: → 9 → 21 → 16 → 1 → 12
- Bottom to left: → 18 → 13 → 19 → 7 → 24 → 23 → 5
- Up left side: → 11 → 15
- Back through center: → 3 → 22 → 2

Verifying this visits all 25 points exactly once and checking key segment distances shows this creates a reasonably efficient loop without major crossings.

2, 20, 6, 4, 8, 10, 17, 25, 14, 9, 21, 16, 1, 12, 18, 13, 19, 7, 24, 23, 5, 11, 15, 3, 22
