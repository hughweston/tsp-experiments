Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

**Analyzing Point Positions:**
- Points 1, 2: Middle-left region
- Points 3, 4: Bottom-left region  
- Points 6, 8: Upper-right region
- Point 7: Middle-right region
- Point 5: Lower-right region
- Points 9, 10: Center region

**Building the Tour:**
Starting from the bottom-left and working systematically:

1. Start at point 4 (far left)
2. Go to nearby point 3
3. Move to point 10 (center)
4. Continue to point 9 (center-right)
5. Head to point 5 (bottom-right)
6. Go up to point 7 (middle-right)
7. Continue to point 8 (top-right)
8. Move to point 6 (nearby)
9. Head left to point 2
10. Finish at point 1, returning to 4

**Verifying the tour creates a logical path:**
- 4→3: Short connection in bottom-left
- 3→10→9: Moving through center
- 9→5→7→8→6: Efficient loop through right side
- 6→2→1→4: Return path along left side

This creates a roughly circular tour that minimizes backtracking and long crossings.

4, 3, 10, 9, 5, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1
