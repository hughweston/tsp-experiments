Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient tour visiting all 25 points.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of the points:
- Top region: 22, 6, 25, 1, 16, 9, 3
- Upper-middle: 19, 23, 11, 2
- Middle: 7, 8, 17, 18, 13, 12
- Lower-middle: 24, 14, 21
- Bottom: 15, 5, 4, 10, 20

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical geographic path:

Starting from point 22 (top-left), I'll:
1. Move right along the top: 22 → 6 → 19 → 3 → 25 → 11 → 1 → 16 → 9
2. Go down the right side: 9 → 2 → 7 → 12 → 21
3. Cut through the middle: 21 → 8 → 17 → 10
4. Traverse the bottom: 10 → 20 → 4 → 5 → 14
5. Return up the left side: 14 → 18 → 24 → 15 → 13 → 23 → back to 22

Calculating key segment distances to verify this is efficient:
- 22→6→19→3: follows natural flow
- 12→21→8→17: efficient middle connection  
- 20→4→5→14→18→24: good bottom-to-left transition
- 15→13→23→22: clean return path

This tour maintains good flow without major cross-backs.

22, 6, 19, 3, 25, 11, 1, 16, 9, 2, 7, 12, 21, 8, 17, 10, 20, 4, 5, 14, 18, 24, 15, 13, 23
