Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 30 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Top region: 7, 21, 26, 15, 19, 13, 30
- Upper middle: 1, 2, 14, 25
- Middle: 29, 27, 28, 8, 24, 17
- Lower middle: 10, 18, 20, 5, 11, 23, 22
- Bottom: 6, 9, 3, 4, 12, 16

I'll construct a tour by working around the perimeter and through clusters:

Starting from point 7 (top left area):
- Go through upper section: 7 → 21 → 25 → 13 → 26 → 30 → 15 → 19
- Down the right side: 19 → 17 → 14 → 2 → 24 → 22 → 23
- Through bottom-right area: 23 → 12 → 16 → 4 → 11 → 3 → 9 → 5
- Through center-left: 5 → 8 → 20 → 18
- Up the left side: 18 → 6 → 10 → 28 → 27 → 29 → 1
- Close the loop: 1 → 7

Verifying this creates a logical path that minimizes backtracking and crosses, connecting nearby points efficiently.

7, 21, 25, 13, 26, 30, 15, 19, 17, 14, 2, 24, 22, 23, 12, 16, 4, 11, 3, 9, 5, 8, 20, 18, 6, 10, 28, 27, 29, 1
