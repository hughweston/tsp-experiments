Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 15 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the positions:
- Point 7: far left, upper
- Point 10: left-center, upper
- Point 2: left, middle
- Point 13: center-left, upper
- Point 5: center, top
- Point 9: center, upper
- Point 8: center-right, upper
- Point 3: right, top
- Point 15: far right, upper
- Point 12: right, middle
- Point 1: right, lower
- Point 6: center-right, lower
- Point 11: center, middle
- Point 14: center, bottom
- Point 4: left, lower

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points consecutively.

Starting from point 7 (top-left), I'll trace a path:
- Go right along the upper region: 7 → 10 → 13 → 5 → 9 → 8 → 3 → 15
- Then down the right side: 15 → 12 → 1
- Across the lower portion: 1 → 6 → 11 → 14 → 4
- Back to start: 4 → 2 → 7

Checking this creates a roughly circular path without major crossings:
- Upper section flows left to right
- Right side descends
- Lower section returns left
- Closes the loop back to 7

This tour visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to start.

7, 10, 13, 5, 9, 8, 3, 15, 12, 1, 6, 11, 14, 4, 2
