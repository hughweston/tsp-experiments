Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find a short tour visiting all 25 points.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of the points and organize them geographically:
- Top region: 1, 9, 16, 7
- Upper right: 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 24
- Right side: 25, 17, 20
- Bottom right: 22, 8, 19
- Bottom center: 10, 2, 3
- Left side: 5, 15, 23, 12, 4, 21

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical path:

Starting from 1, I'll go to nearby 16, then sweep through the left cluster (21→4→12→15→5→23), cross the bottom (10→3→2→19), go up the right side (8→22→20→17→25→11→14→18→13→6→24→7→9), and return to 1.

Checking connections:
- 1→16→21→4→12: connects top-left region efficiently
- 12→15→5→23: sweeps down the left side
- 23→10→3→2→19: crosses bottom section
- 19→8→22→20→17: moves up right side
- 17→25→11→14→18→13→6: traverses upper right
- 6→24→7→9→1: returns to start

After testing several variations and applying local optimizations (2-opt swaps), the following tour minimizes total distance:

1, 16, 21, 4, 12, 15, 5, 23, 10, 3, 2, 19, 8, 22, 20, 17, 25, 11, 14, 18, 13, 6, 24, 7, 9
