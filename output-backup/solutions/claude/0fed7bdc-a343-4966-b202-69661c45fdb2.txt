Looking at this TSP instance, I need to identify the coordinates of all 15 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the coordinates:
- Point 1: (640, 345)
- Point 2: (720, 120)
- Point 3: (595, 65)
- Point 4: (390, 255)
- Point 5: (680, 125)
- Point 6: (480, 330)
- Point 7: (245, 80)
- Point 8: (520, 380)
- Point 9: (420, 320)
- Point 10: (45, 405)
- Point 11: (55, 180)
- Point 12: (150, 65)
- Point 13: (595, 245)
- Point 14: (215, 385)
- Point 15: (400, 40)

I'll identify geographic clusters:
- Upper left: 11, 12, 7
- Upper center/right: 15, 3, 2, 5
- Middle: 4, 13
- Lower: 10, 14, 9, 6, 8, 1

Building a tour that minimizes backtracking by moving around the perimeter and efficiently connecting clusters:

Starting from the bottom left (10), going up the left side (11→12→7), across the top (15→3), down the right side (5→2→13→1), and returning through the bottom (8→6→9→4→14) back to start.

After applying 2-opt improvements, I found that visiting 3→5→2→13 (instead of 3→2→5→13) saves distance.

Calculating key distances to verify:
- 10→11: 225
- 11→12: 149
- 12→7: 96
- 7→15: 160
- 15→3: 197
- 3→5: 104
- 5→2: 40
- 2→13: 177
- 13→1: 110
- 1→8: 125
- 8→6: 64
- 6→9: 61
- 9→4: 72
- 4→14: 218
- 14→10: 171

Total: ~1969
