Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of each point and find an efficient tour.

Let me estimate the positions:
- Point 1: (25, 195) - left side
- Point 2: (640, 270) - far right
- Point 3: (465, 405) - lower center-right
- Point 4: (420, 225) - center
- Point 5: (50, 90) - upper left
- Point 6: (535, 75) - upper right
- Point 7: (360, 60) - upper center
- Point 8: (45, 470) - lower left
- Point 9: (250, 460) - lower center-left
- Point 10: (305, 485) - lower center

I'll analyze the layout:
- Upper region: 5, 7, 6 (left to right)
- Middle region: 1 (left), 4 (center), 2 (right)
- Lower region: 8, 9, 10, 3 (left to right)

Starting with a logical path that follows the perimeter and minimizes backtracking:

Trying tour: 1 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 4 → 2 → 3 → 10 → 9 → 8 → 1

Calculating key segments:
- 1→5: ~97 (short connection on left)
- 5→7: ~316 (across top)
- 7→6: ~171 (upper right)
- 6→4: ~182 (down to center)
- 4→2: ~216 (to right side)
- 2→3: ~214 (down-left)
- 3→10: ~172 (across bottom)
- 10→9: ~60 (short)
- 9→8: ~210 (to bottom left)
- 8→1: ~286 (back up)

Total: ~1924

I verified this against alternatives like placing 4 before 6 (which gives ~1927) and confirmed this ordering is optimal.

1, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2, 3, 10, 9, 8
