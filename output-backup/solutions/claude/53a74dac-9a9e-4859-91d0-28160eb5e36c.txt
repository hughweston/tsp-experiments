Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 25 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Upper left region: 15, 23, 1, 24
- Upper middle: 21, 9, 25, 16
- Upper right: 18, 12, 8, 14
- Middle: 6, 7, 22
- Lower middle: 11, 19, 4, 17
- Bottom: 2, 5, 3
- Left side: 10, 13, 20

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence:

Starting from 15 (top left), I'll:
1. Go to nearby 24, then handle the isolated point 10 via the left side
2. Continue through the bottom-left cluster (13, 20, 3, 5)
3. Move through the middle points (11, 19, 4)
4. Go to the bottom-right area (2, 17)
5. Traverse the right side (22, 14, 8, 12, 18)
6. Return through the upper area (16, 25, 9, 21, 7, 6, 1, 23)
7. Back to 15

Calculating key distances and optimizing connections, the tour that minimizes total distance:

15 → 24 → 10 → 13 → 20 → 3 → 5 → 11 → 19 → 4 → 2 → 17 → 22 → 14 → 8 → 12 → 18 → 16 → 25 → 9 → 21 → 7 → 6 → 1 → 23 → 15

This route efficiently connects the bottom-left isolated area (10, 13, 20) early, handles the bottom section (3, 5, 2), traverses the right side cluster, and returns through the upper portion.

15, 24, 10, 13, 20, 3, 5, 11, 19, 4, 2, 17, 22, 14, 8, 12, 18, 16, 25, 9, 21, 7, 6, 1, 23
