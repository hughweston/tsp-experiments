Looking at this TSP problem, I need to find an efficient tour through all 30 points.

Let me identify the general layout:
- Top region: 8, 19, 4, 17, 30, 23, 20
- Upper-middle: 18, 15, 24, 10, 25, 28
- Middle: 2, 3, 12, 29, 21, 6, 1
- Left side: 14, 16, 11
- Bottom: 9, 27, 7, 22, 26, 13
- Right side: 5

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by moving through logical clusters:

Starting from point 1, I'll:
1. Go up to the upper-middle region (2 → 18 → 28)
2. Sweep left through middle points (3 → 12 → 29)
3. Connect to center and bottom-left cluster (21 → 22 → 7 → 27 → 11 → 9 → 16 → 14)
4. Move to top-left (8 → 19)
5. Traverse top region left to right (20 → 4 → 17 → 30 → 23)
6. Drop down right side (15 → 24 → 10 → 25 → 6 → 5)
7. Complete bottom section (13 → 26) back to 1

Checking key optimizations:
- Moving 15 to after 23 (instead of after 2) saves significant distance
- The left-side cluster (9 → 16 → 14 → 8) flows naturally
- Right side descent (24 → 10 → 25) is efficient given their proximity

After analyzing various 2-opt improvements and verifying the connections, my optimized tour is:

1, 2, 18, 28, 3, 12, 29, 21, 22, 7, 27, 11, 9, 16, 14, 8, 19, 20, 4, 17, 30, 23, 15, 24, 10, 25, 6, 5, 13, 26
