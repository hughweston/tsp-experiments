Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 10 points and find an efficient route.

**Analyzing point positions:**
- Top region: Point 5 (left), Point 7 (right), Point 10 (below 5)
- Right side: Point 1 (upper right), Point 6 (far right, middle)
- Bottom region: Point 3 (far left), Point 8 (left), Point 2 (above 8), Point 4 (center), Point 9 (right of center)

**Strategy:**
I'll look for a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical path around the perimeter and through clusters.

**Evaluating routes:**
Starting from point 5, I can go clockwise through the top-right points, then down to the bottom cluster, and back up.

Testing tour: 5 → 7 → 1 → 6 → 9 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 3 → 10 → 5
- 5 to 7: connects top points
- 7 to 1 to 6: follows right side down
- 6 to 9: crosses to bottom cluster
- 9 to 4 to 2 to 8 to 3: efficient path through bottom (moving left)
- 3 to 10 to 5: returns via left side to top

**Checking alternatives:**
- Tried various reorderings of bottom cluster - current order (9→4→2→8→3) is most efficient
- Tried connecting 10 differently - connecting to 5 and 3 works best for overall tour
- 2-opt improvements don't yield better results

The route follows a roughly circular path, minimizing long crossings.

5, 7, 1, 6, 9, 4, 2, 8, 3, 10
