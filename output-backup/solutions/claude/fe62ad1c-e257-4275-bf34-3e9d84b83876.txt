Looking at the image, I need to identify the coordinates of all 25 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Top area: 2 (far left), 24 (center-left), 10 (right), 11 (below 10)
- Upper middle: 1, 12, 25, 21, 7
- Right side: 4, 18, 13, 6, 16, 20
- Center: 14, 9
- Bottom: 17, 23, 19, 3
- Left side: 22, 8, 15, 5

I'll construct a tour that follows a logical path around the perimeter while efficiently visiting interior points:

Starting from top-left (2), going across the top:
- 2 → 24 → 1 → 21 → 10 → 11

Down the right side:
- 11 → 7 → 4 → 18 → 13 → 6 → 16 → 20

Through the middle and bottom:
- 20 → 14 → 9 → 17 → 23

Up the left side, picking up remaining points:
- 23 → 5 → 19 → 3 → 15 → 8 → 22 → 25 → 12

Back to start (2)

This creates a roughly circular tour that minimizes backtracking and long jumps.
