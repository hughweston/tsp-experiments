Looking at this TSP problem, I need to identify the coordinates of all 20 points and find an efficient tour.

Let me analyze the point positions:
- Left cluster: 2, 4, 7, 9, 18
- Top area: 5, 17
- Center: 3, 8, 10, 12, 20
- Right cluster: 1, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16
- Bottom: 6, 19

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points consecutively:

Starting from point 4, I'll go:
- Up the left side: 4 → 9 → 5 → 17
- Across the top-right: → 15 → 11 → 13 → 16 → 14
- Down the right side: → 1 → 19
- Through the bottom-center: → 6 → 10 → 8 → 20 → 3
- Back through center-left: → 12 → 7 → 2 → 18 → (back to 4)

Let me verify this covers all points efficiently by checking key distances:
- 4→9: short horizontal
- 9→5→17: diagonal up to top
- 17→15→11→13→16→14→1: traversing right side
- 1→19: down right side
- 19→6→10→8→20→3: through bottom/center area
- 3→12→7→2→18→4: returning through left side

This creates a roughly circular tour minimizing cross-tour jumps.

4, 9, 5, 17, 15, 11, 13, 16, 14, 1, 19, 6, 10, 8, 20, 3, 12, 7, 2, 18
