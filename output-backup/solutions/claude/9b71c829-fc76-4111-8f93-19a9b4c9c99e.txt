Looking at this TSP problem with 25 points, I need to find an efficient tour by analyzing the point positions and clustering.

Let me identify the general layout:
- Top-left area: 7, 20, 23
- Left side: 1, 13, 5, 17, 12
- Bottom: 11, 3
- Center: 6, 2, 8, 10, 14
- Right side: 21, 19, 22, 25, 16, 4, 18
- Bottom-right: 9, 24, 15

I'll construct a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical path through these clusters:

Starting from 7 (top-left), I'll go through the upper-center points (6, 2), then to the right side cluster (21, 19, 22, 25, 16, 4, 18), down to bottom-right (9, 24, 15), through center (8, 14, 10), down to bottom-left (3, 11, 5), up the left side (13, 1, 17, 12, 23, 20), and back to 7.

Calculating key distances to verify this is efficient:
- 7→6: ~135, 6→2: ~68, 2→21: ~173
- Right side chain: 21→19→22→25→16→4→18→9→24→15 forms a good path
- 15→8→14→10: connects center well
- Bottom left: 3→11→5→13→1 is efficient
- Left return: 1→17→12→23→20→7 completes the loop

7, 6, 2, 21, 19, 22, 25, 16, 4, 18, 9, 24, 15, 8, 14, 10, 3, 11, 5, 13, 1, 17, 12, 23, 20
