To determine the shortest tour for this Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instance, I will trace the path by connecting the nearest neighbors visually, ensuring no paths cross and forming a closed loop that visits every city.

Here is the step-by-step visual trace:

1.  **Start at the cluster in the bottom right:** Let's begin at point **9**. The closest point is clearly **8**.
2.  **Move up the right side:** From **8**, the next logical point moving towards the main group is **14**.
3.  **Cross to the center:** From **14**, the path has to jump a significant distance to rejoin the main cluster. The most central connection is towards **1** or **13**. Let's go to **1**.
4.  **Navigate the upper-middle cluster:** From **1**, the immediate neighbor is **13**.
5.  From **13**, going down slightly to **17** makes sense.
6.  From **17**, the path naturally flows down to **7**.
7.  **Loop around the bottom left:** From **7**, move left to **20**.
8.  From **20**, go to the far bottom-left corner at **19**.
9.  From **19**, the next point up is **12**.
10. **Move up the left side:** From **12**, the path goes inward to **11**.
11. From **11**, connect to **3**.
12. From **3**, continue up to **2**.
13. **Move to the upper left:** From **2**, the path must jump to the upper-left cluster. The best connection is to **6**.
14. From **6**, go to the outermost point, **5**.
15. From **5**, move inwards to **18**.
16. **Complete the top section:** From **18**, move right to **15**.
17. From **15**, go up to the peak, **10**.
18. From **10**, come down to **4**.
19. From **4**, connect to **16**.
20. **Close the loop:** From **16**, the path would naturally connect back to our starting area near **1**, but since we already visited 1, we look at the overall shape. The connection between **16** and **1** is very close, completing the cycle we started earlier (where 14 connected to 1).

Let's re-verify the overall loop order to ensure smoothness and minimal crossing:
9 -> 8 -> 14 -> 1 -> 13 -> 17 -> 7 -> 20 -> 19 -> 12 -> 11 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 18 -> 15 -> 10 -> 4 -> 16 -> (back to 1, but actually 14 connects better to 1 or 16? Let's re-evaluate the 14 connection).

*Correction:* Looking closely at **14**, it's quite isolated. A path going 16 -> 1 -> 13 -> 14 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 is a massive detour. A better route for that right side is likely:
... -> 16 -> 1 -> 13 -> 17 -> 7 -> (detour to right) -> 8 -> 9 -> 14 -> (back to center) ... wait, 14 is closer to 1 than 7 is to 8.
Let's try this flow:
... -> 4 -> 16 -> 1 -> 13 -> 17 -> 7 -> 20 ... (left side loop) ... -> 2 -> 6 ... (top left) ... -> 15 -> 10 -> 4.
Where do 8, 9, 14 fit?
The gap between 7 and 8 is huge. The gap between 14 and 1/13/16/17 is also large, but smaller than the 7-8 gap.
The gap between 14 and 9 is large.
Actually, looking at the spatial layout:
14 is relatively close to 1/13/16.
8 and 9 are very isolated. The only way to get to them efficiently is likely from 7 or 14.
However, 14 -> 8 is a long way. 7 -> 20 -> ... -> 17 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 14 -> 1 doesn't look like a simple loop.

Let's look at the standard "outer hull" approach.
Start bottom left: 19 -> 12 -> 11 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 18 -> 15 -> 10 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1 -> 13 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 20 -> 19.

Let's trace that specific sequence to see if it creates a valid, non-crossing tour.
- 19 to 12 (Good)
- 12 to 11 (Good)
- 11 to 3 (Good)
- 3 to 2 (Good)
- 2 to 6 (Good)
- 6 to 5 (Good)
- 5 to 18 (Good)
- 18 to 15 (Good)
- 15 to 10 (Good)
- 10 to 4 (Good)
- 4 to 16 (Good)
- 16 to 1 (Good - tight cluster)
- 1 to 13 (Good - tight cluster)
- 13 to 17 (Good)
- 17 to 14 (This is a long jump, but likely the shortest way to include the outlier 14 without crossing the 7-20-19-12 chain)
- 14 to 9 (Long jump, but necessary to grab the corner)
- 9 to 8 (Obvious pair)
- 8 to 7 (Long jump back to the main group)
- 7 to 20 (Good)
- 20 to 19 (Closes the loop)

This creates a "C" shape that opens to the right, sweeping up the outliers 14, 9, 8. This looks like the optimal path.

**Final Path:**
19, 12, 11, 3, 2, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10, 4, 16, 1, 13, 17, 14, 9, 8, 7, 20

19, 12, 11, 3, 2, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10, 4, 16, 1, 13, 17, 14, 9, 8, 7, 20
