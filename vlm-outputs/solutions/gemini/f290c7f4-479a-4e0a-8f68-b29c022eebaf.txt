Based on visual inspection of the points, the shortest path follows the most logical "loop" or perimeter around the scattered points, moving into clusters where appropriate to minimize travel distance.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Starting at the top left, let's begin with **3**.
2.  Move right to the next closest point: **10**.
3.  Continue generally rightward to **6**.
4.  Then slightly down and right to **11**.
5.  Now, looking at the layout, the path needs to swing towards the right side. The next logical cluster is the pair on the far right. So, we travel from 11 down to **4**.
6.  The closest point to 4 is **8**.
7.  From 8, the next nearest point is down towards the bottom right, which is **13**.
8.  From 13, we move leftward along the bottom. The next point is **9**.
9.  Continuing left, we hit **1**.
10. Further left is **2**.
11. From 2, the path swings up to the far left point, **14**.
12. From 14, we need to visit the central cluster before returning to the start. The closest point in the middle cluster is **15**.
13. Right next to it is **12**.
14. Slightly up and right is **7**.
15. And finally, adjacent to 7 is **5**. (From 5, the path would close back to 3, completing a relatively efficient loop).

So, the order is:
3, 10, 6, 11, 4, 8, 13, 9, 1, 2, 14, 15, 12, 7, 5

**Answer:**
3, 10, 6, 11, 4, 8, 13, 9, 1, 2, 14, 15, 12, 7, 5
