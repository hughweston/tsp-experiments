To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I'll visually trace the shortest path connecting all 30 points. I'll start from a point on the periphery, like point 27, and work my way around the set of points to form a closed loop.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Start at **27** (bottom left).
2.  Move down to **29**.
3.  Then to **24** right next to it.
4.  Move right to **16**.
5.  Then down to **10**.
6.  Move up and right to **12**.
7.  Continue right to **3**.
8.  Then to **14**.
9.  Continue right to **18**.
10. Then to **19**.
11. Drop down to **15**.
12. Move up and right to **11** (far right edge).
13. Move left to **9**.
14. Move up to **17**.
15. Move right to **13**.
16. Move right to **21**.
17. Move right to **2** (far right).
18. Move up and left to **28**.
19. Move down and left to **1**.
20. Move down and left to **4**.
21. Move left to **22**.
22. Move down to **5**.
23. Move left to **20**.
24. Move up and left to **8**.
25. Move up and left to **23**.
26. Move up to **26** (top point).
27. Move down and left to **25**.
28. Move down to **30**.
29. Move right to **7**.
30. Move up to **6**.
31. From 6, the path naturally loops back to the start point 27, closing the tour.

Here is the sequence of points:

**27, 29, 24, 16, 10, 12, 3, 14, 18, 19, 15, 11, 9, 17, 13, 21, 2, 28, 1, 4, 22, 5, 20, 8, 23, 26, 25, 30, 7, 6**
