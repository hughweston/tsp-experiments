To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I'll identify a path that visits all 30 points exactly once, minimizing the total distance by connecting nearest neighbors in a logical loop.

Here is the step-by-step tour:

1.  Starting on the far right edge, let's begin with **21**.
2.  Move up to the next closest point, **9**.
3.  Continue upwards to the top right corner: **1**, then **29**.
4.  Now sweep towards the top center. The next nearest point is **18**.
5.  Move down slightly to **13**.
6.  Continue moving left towards **24**.
7.  Drop down to **4**.
8.  Move further left to the isolated point **30**.
9.  Now sweep back inwards towards the bottom left: **19**, then down to the corner **6**.
10. Move right along the bottom edge: **3**, then up slightly to **8**.
11. From 8, move into the central cluster, starting with **15**.
12. Move slightly up and left to **16**, then up again to **23**.
13. From 23, connect to the nearby **7**.
14. Move right to **14**.
15. Go up to **5**.
16. Come back down to the center-right group: connect to **26**.
17. Drop down to **25**.
18. Move right to **20**.
19. Move slightly right to **27**.
20. Move up to **2**.
21. Drop down/right to **11**.
22. Now head towards the bottom right area. Go to **17**.
23. Continue down to **28**.
24. Move further down to **10**.
25. Move right to **12**.
26. Go down to the bottommost point **22**.
27. The path would then naturally loop back up towards 21 to close the circuit.

**Final Path:**
21, 9, 1, 29, 18, 13, 24, 4, 30, 19, 6, 3, 8, 15, 16, 23, 7, 14, 5, 26, 25, 20, 27, 2, 11, 17, 28, 10, 12, 22
