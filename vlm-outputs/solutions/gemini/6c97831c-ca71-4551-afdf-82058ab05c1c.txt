To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I'll visually inspect the points to form the shortest possible loop. The goal is to connect nearest neighbors while avoiding crossing paths and covering the entire set of points efficiently.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  **Start at the bottom left with point 7.** It's an outlier, so it's a good starting reference.
2.  Move up to **point 5**.
3.  Continue moving left/up to **point 11**.
4.  Move towards the top cluster, hitting **point 15**.
5.  Go to **point 12**.
6.  Move slightly up to **point 6**.
7.  Now, move down into the central vertical cluster. First is **point 3**.
8.  Just below it is **point 13**.
9.  Then **point 10** is nearby to the right.
10. Move out to the far right to catch the outliers. Go to **point 8**.
11. Continue right to **point 9**.
12. Sweep back down to the bottom right corner to **point 1**.
13. Move left towards the center bottom cluster. Go to **point 14**.
14. Go up slightly to **point 2**.
15. Finally, hit **point 4**, which positions us perfectly to close the loop back to point 7 (though we don't list 7 again).

Let's verify the loop:
7 -> 5 -> 11 -> 15 -> 12 -> 6 -> 3 -> 13 -> 10 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1 -> 14 -> 2 -> 4 -> (back to 7).

This path creates a clean perimeter with no crossing lines and connects nearest neighbors logically.

**Answer:**
7, 5, 11, 15, 12, 6, 3, 13, 10, 8, 9, 1, 14, 2, 4
