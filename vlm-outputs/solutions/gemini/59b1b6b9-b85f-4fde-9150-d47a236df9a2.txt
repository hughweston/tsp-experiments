To find the shortest tour for the given set of points, I will visually trace the most logical path that minimizes distance by connecting nearest neighbors without creating long crossings. This is essentially solving the "convex hull" of the outer points and picking up the inner points along the way.

Here is the step-by-step visual analysis:

1.  **Start at an extremity:** Let's start at point **8** (top right), as it's an outlier.
2.  **Move to the nearest neighbor:** The closest point to 8 is clearly **2**.
3.  **Continue along the path:** From 2, the next logical step towards the cluster is **4**.
4.  **Navigate the left side:** From 4, we move left to the next closest point, which is **10**.
5.  **Move down:** From 10, the path naturally flows down to **3**.
6.  **Continue down:** From 3, the nearest point is **6**.
7.  **Loop towards the bottom:** From 6, we head towards the bottom left corner, point **7**.
8.  **Traverse the bottom:** From 7, we move to the next bottom point, **5**.
9.  **Head back up/right:** From 5, we start closing the loop by moving to **1**. Note that 1 is somewhat central, but it connects 5 to the remaining right-side point. However, looking closer, a better perimeter path might be 7 -> 5 -> 9. Let's re-evaluate. The path 5 -> 9 is quite long. Let's look at the cluster 6-1-9-5.
    *   Let's re-trace from 6. 6 is close to 1. But 7 is an outlier. The path likely goes ...3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> ... No, 1 to 9 is far.
    *   Let's try a strict perimeter approach (often optimal for Euclidean TSP):
        *   Outer loop seems to be: 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> (back to 8).
        *   Let's check the connection 1 -> 9 vs 5 -> 9. 5 is closer to 9 than 1 is. 1 is closer to 6 and 5.
        *   Let's try: 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> (back to 3).
            *   This creates a crossing between (9->1) and (5->7) or (1->5) potentially.
        *   Let's try to simply connect "closest unvisited neighbor":
            *   Start at **8**. Nearest is **2**.
            *   From **2**, nearest is **4**.
            *   From **4**, nearest is **10** (or maybe 3, but 10 is on the edge). Let's go **10**.
            *   From **10**, nearest is **3**.
            *   From **3**, nearest is **6**.
            *   From **6**, nearest is **1**.
            *   From **1**, nearest is **5** (or 9? 5 looks closer). Let's go **5**.
            *   From **5**, nearest is **7**.
            *   From **7**, now we have a problem. We need to get to 9 and back to 8. The jump from 7 to 9 is huge. This suggests 7 shouldn't be a dead end. 7 must connect to 6 or 5.
    *   Let's try a "circular sweep" method starting from the top right and going counter-clockwise:
        *   **8** -> **2** (move inwards slightly) -> **4** (top) -> **10** (top left) -> **3** -> **6** -> **7** (bottom left) -> **5** (bottom) -> **1** (center-ish) -> **9** (right) -> close back to 8.
        *   Let's check the 5->1->9 segment. 5 to 1 is a short jump. 1 to 9 is a medium jump. 9 to 8 is a long jump but necessary to close the loop.
        *   Is there a better way? Maybe 5 -> 9 -> 1? No, 9 is an outlier on the right. 1 is in the middle. If we do 5 -> 9 -> 1, then from 1 we have to get back to 8... 1 to 8 is very far and crosses other paths.
        *   So 9 must connect to 8. That means the sequence ends ... -> 9 -> 8.
        *   Who connects to 9? 1 or 5? 1 is closer to 9 than 5 is. Or maybe 2? No, 2 is already linked to 8.
        *   Let's look at the 6, 1, 3 area. 6 is very close to 1. The path segment **3 -> 6 -> 7** skips 1. Maybe **3 -> 10** is wrong.
        *   Let's try: **8, 2, 4, 10, 3, 6, 1, 5, 7**... now we are stuck at 7.
        *   Let's rethink the bottom loop. 7 is an outlier. It must connect to 5 and 6. If it connects to 5 and 6, the path segment is ...6 -> 7 -> 5...
        *   If we have ...6 -> 7 -> 5..., where does 1 go? 1 is near 6 and 5. So maybe **1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5**. Or **6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1**.
        *   Let's try tracing **8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9**.
            *   Connection 1 to 9 is the only slightly long internal link, but it avoids crossing lines.
            *   Connection 9 to 8 closes the loop. This looks like a clean polygon with 1 tucked inside.
            *   Let's verify if 1 fits better elsewhere. Maybe **3 -> 1 -> 6**? No, 1 is to the right of 6.
            *   Maybe **5 -> 9 -> 1**? If we go 5 -> 9 -> 1, then 1 must connect to something else to close the loop (e.g., 2 or 6). 1 to 6 is good. So, **...5 -> 9 -> 1 -> 6...**
            *   Let's trace that: **8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7**... now stuck at 7 again. 7 needs two neighbors. 6 and 5 are the only reasonable ones. So the sequence **6-7-5** (or reverse) is almost certainly part of the optimal path.
            *   If we fix **6-7-5**, we are at 5. Next nearest is 1 or 9.
            *   If we go **5 -> 1**, from 1 we go to **9**. From 9 we go to **8**.
            *   Let's check the other side of the fixed segment: **6**. From 6 we go to **3**.
            *   Let's trace the full proposed loop: **8 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 2 -> (back to 8)**.
            *   Let's critique the link **9 -> 1**. It's okay.
            *   Let's critique the link **1 -> 5**. It's short. Good.
            *   Let's critique **1 -> 6**? The path 1->6 is very short. If we skip it (going 6->7 instead), we miss a close connection.
            *   Alternative: **...3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7...** No, 5 to 7 to where? 7 is a dead end if not connected to 6 and 5.
            *   Wait, look at point 1 again. It is between 6, 5, 9, and 2.
            *   Is it possible the path is **...5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3...**? 1 to 3 is longer than 1 to 6.
            *   How about **...6 -> 1 -> 9...**? Then 9 goes to 8. Then 8->2->4->10->3. Then 3 must connect to 6. This works: **3-6-1-9-8-2-4-10-3**. Wait, we missed 5 and 7.
            *   So 5 and 7 must be inserted. 5 is near 1 and 9. 7 is near 6 and 5.
            *   Let's try to "pocket" 7: **...6 -> 7 -> 5...**
            *   Where does 1 go? 1 is very close to 6. But 6 is connected to 3 and 7. That breaks the short 1-6 link.
            *   Is it possible 7 connects to 5 and 1? No, 7 is far from 1. 7 connects to 6 and 5 best.
            *   So the segment is likely **6-7-5**.
            *   From 5, the closest is 1. So **5-1**.
            *   From 1, the closest unvisited is 9. So **1-9**.
            *   From 9, go up to 8. **9-8**.
            *   From 8, loop back around top. **8-2-4-10-3**.
            *   From 3, close to 6. **3-6**.
            *   This gives the full tour: **3, 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6**.
            *   Let's check the link **9 -> 1**. Distance looks moderate.
            *   Let's check the link **1 -> 5**. Distance is short.
            *   Let's check **3 -> 6**. Distance is short.
            *   Let's compare this to **...5 -> 9 -> 8...** and inserting 1 elsewhere.
            *   If 1 is inserted between 6 and 3: **3-1-6**. 3 to 1 is far. Bad.
            *   If 1 is inserted between 6 and 7: **6-1-7**. 1 to 7 is very far. Bad.
            *   If 1 is inserted between 3 and 10: **10-1-3**. Far.
            *   It seems 1 sits naturally between 5 and 9, or 6 and 9?
            *   Let's re-evaluate connection **1-6**. They are very close. If we don't connect them, we are "wasting" a short edge.
            *   If we connect **1-6**, then 6 connects to 7. **1-6-7**. From 7 we go to 5. **1-6-7-5**. From 5, where to? 9. **5-9**. From 9 to 8. **9-8**. Loop around top to 3. **8-2-4-10-3**. From 3 we need to close to 1. **3-1**.
            *   Compare the "bad" links:
                *   Scenario A (1 connected to 5 and 9): Bad link is **3->6** (short/good) and **9->1** (medium).
                *   Scenario B (1 connected to 6 and 3): Bad link is **5->9** (medium) and **3->1** (medium/long). 1->3 cuts across.
                *   Scenario C (1 connected to 6 and 5?): **...3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7...** wait, 7 is a dead end again. 7 connects to 6 and... 3? No.
            *   Let's look at 1 again. 1 is almost collinear with 6 and 9? No. 6, 1, 9 creates a slight angle.
            *   What about **6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7**? 1 to 5 is short. 6 to 1 is short. This uses two very short edges.
                *   From 7, we must go to... well, there's nothing left but to go back towards 3 or 9, which is impossible. 7 is a corner. It MUST connect to its two geometric neighbors on the hull, which are 6 and 5.
                *   Therefore, the sequence **6 - 7 - 5** is geometrically forced to avoid crossing lines and long jumps.
            *   With **6-7-5** locked in:
                *   We are at 5. We must leave 5. The neighbors are 1 and 9.
                *   If we go **5 -> 9**: Then 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3. From 3, we must close the loop to 6. But we left 1 stranded!
                *   So we must visit 1 after 5 or before 6.
                *   If we visit 1 after 5: **5 -> 1**. From 1, nearest is 9 (or 6, but 6 is already visited). So **1 -> 9**. Then **9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3**. Finally **3 -> 6** (closes the loop).
                *   This creates the path: **10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3**.
                *   Let's visualize the segment **9 -> 1 -> 5**. 9 to 1 is a clean straight line. 1 to 5 is a clean straight line. 5 to 7 is clean. 7 to 6 is clean. 6 to 3 is clean. 3 to 10 is clean.
                *   This looks like the optimal solution. It forms a nice "C" shape spiraling in and out without self-intersections.

Let's double check lengths visually.
- Path A: ...6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 8...
    - Segments: 6-7 (med), 7-5 (med), 5-1 (short), 1-9 (med), 9-8 (long).
- Is there any other way to handle 1?
    - What if we go ...6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> (jump to 3? no) -> (jump to 9? no).
    - What if we go ...3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 8...
        - 3->1 is longer than 3->6.
        - 1->6 is shorter than 6->3.
        - 5->9 is slightly longer than 1->9.
        - Visually, the detour 3->1->6 "crimps" the polygon inward awkwardly. The path 3->6 flows better.
        - Also 3->1 passes somewhat close to 6, creating congestion.

The most natural flow is definitely following the convex hull (8-2-4-10-3-7-5-9) and inserting the indentations where they minimize distance.
- 7 is an indentation between 6 and 5? No, 7 is the corner. 6 and 5 are the arms.
- 1 is an indentation between 5 and 9? Or 6 and 9?
    - If 1 is between 5 and 9: path is 5-1-9. (Distance cost: 5->1 + 1->9 vs 5->9 direct. 5->1 is short, 1->9 is med. 5->9 is med/long. This insertion is cheap).
    - If 1 is between 6 and 9: path is 6-1-9. (Distance cost: 6->1 + 1->9 vs 6->9 direct. 6->1 is short. 1->9 is med. 6->9 is long and cuts through the middle. This is a very good insertion).
    - Wait, if we do 6-1-9, then how do we handle 5 and 7?
        - The sequence would be ...3 -> (something) -> 6 -> 1 -> 9 -> 8...
        - But 7 and 5 are "hanging" off the bottom left. We established 7 must connect to 6 and 5.
        - If 7 connects to 6, we can't do 6-1-9 because 6 has 2 connections already (3 and 7).
        - Unless... 3 connects to 1? **3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9**...
            - 3 -> 1 is quite long.
            - 5 -> 9 is long.
        - So the "pocket" 1 sits between 5 and 9 seems most efficient.

Let's verify the "pocket" logic.
- We have a loop mostly defined by the outer ring: 8-2-4-10-3-6-7-5-9-8.
- We need to insert 1.
- Insertion costs (approximate):
    - Insert 1 into 6-7 edge: Remove 6-7, add 6-1 + 1-7. (1-7 is HUGE). Bad.
    - Insert 1 into 7-5 edge: Remove 7-5, add 7-1 + 1-5. (7-1 is HUGE). Bad.
    - Insert 1 into 5-9 edge: Remove 5-9, add 5-1 + 1-9. (5-9 is ~dist(5,9). 5-1 is very small. 1-9 is < 5-9). This reduces total length! It satisfies the triangle inequality clearly, but visually 5,1,9 are almost collinear, with 1 being much closer to 5. Actually, 5-9 is the base of a triangle 5-1-9. Since 1 is "inside" the hull, usually visiting it adds length. But here, 1 is somewhat between 5 and 9. Distance(5,9) looks larger than Distance(5,1) + Distance(1,9). Wait, triangle inequality says direct is always shorter. But we are looking for the *cheapest insertion*.
    - Let's compare insertion into 5-9 vs insertion into 6-3.
        - Insert into 6-3: Remove 6-3, add 6-1, 1-3. 6-1 is very short. 1-3 is long. Total added length = (Short + Long) - Short = Long.
        - Insert into 5-9: Remove 5-9, add 5-1, 1-9. 5-1 is Short. 1-9 is Med. 5-9 is Med/Long. Added length = (Short + Med) - Med/Long. This looks like the smallest penalty.
    - Is there an insertion into 6-9? No, 6 and 9 aren't connected in the base hull.

Conclusion: The standard perimeter path is 8-2-4-10-3-6-7-5-9-8. Point 1 is the only internal point. The cheapest place to insert point 1 is between 5 and 9.

Path:
... -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 8 -> ...
or
... -> 8 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> ...

Let's list the full sequence starting from 1 for simplicity, then rotate to match the example format or just pick a start like 10.
Order: 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3.

Let's double check crossing.
10-4: clear
4-2: clear
2-8: clear
8-9: clear
9-1: goes inward.
1-5: clear small step.
5-7: clear bottom edge.
7-6: clear bottom-left edge.
6-3: clear left edge.
3-10: clear top-left edge.

Does 9-1 cross anything?
Line segment 9-1 runs from mid-right to center.
Line segment 5-7 runs bottom-center to bottom-left. No intersect.
Line segment 6-3 runs mid-left up. No intersect.
Line segment 2-8 runs top-right. No intersect.

Does 3-6 cross anything? No.
Does 1-5 cross anything? No.

The tour 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3 looks valid and optimal.

Let's re-read the numbering to ensure I didn't swap 6 and 3 or something.
- Top left: 10
- Top mid: 4
- Top right (outlier): 8
- Below 8: 2
- Below 4: nothing directly.
- Below 10: 3
- Below 3: 6
- Center: 1
- Below 6: 7 (outlier left)
- Right of 7: 5
- Far right mid: 9

Sequence check:
10 -> 4 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> (back to 10).

Let's verify one alternative: what if 1 connects to 6?
Path: ...3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3...
Segment 1 -> 3 crosses segment 10 -> 3? No. But 1->3 is long.
Segment 1 -> 3 crosses segment 4 -> 10? No.
Visually, 1 is much closer to 5 and 6 than it is to 3.
So 1 should connect to 5 or 6 (or both).
If 1 connects to 6 and 5: Path is ...7 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 9...
Let's check lengths.
Option A: 7->6->3... and ...9->1->5->7. (Current best). Links: 6-3, 9-1, 1-5.
Option B: 7->6->1->5->9... Links: 6-1, 1-5, 5-9.
Compare (6-3 + 9-1) vs (6-1 + 5-9).
6-3 is short. 9-1 is med. Sum = Short + Med.
6-1 is very short. 5-9 is Med/Long. Sum = Very Short + Med/Long.
Visually:
6 to 3 is about same length as 1 to 9.
6 to 1 is very short.
5 to 9 is clearly longer than 1 to 9.
It's a tough call between A and B.
Let's look at the "hole" left behind.
In Option B (visiting 1 between 6 and 5): The loop goes 3->6->1->5->9. The jump 3->6 is good. The jump 6->1 is great. The jump 1->5 is great. The jump 5->9 is the "cost".
In Option A (visiting 1 between 9 and 5): The loop goes 3->6->7->5->1->9. The jump 3->6 is good. 6->7 is good. 7->5 is good. 5->1 is good. 1->9 is "cost".
Wait, in Option B I missed 7.
Correction for Option B: ...3 -> 6 -> 7 -> (visit 1?) -> 5...
7 is far from 1. Can't go 7->1.
So 1 must be adjacent to 6 or 5 to minimize travel.
The neighbors of 7 are 6 and 5. This is geometrically rigid.
So the sequence MUST contain ...6 - 7 - 5... (or reverse).
This implies 1 cannot be between 6 and 5.
So 1 must be attached to 6 (on the 3 side) or attached to 5 (on the 9 side).
Possibility 1: ...3 - 1 - 6 - 7 - 5 - 9... (1 attached to 6).
- Costs: 3-1 (longish), 1-6 (short). Replaces 3-6 (short). Bad trade.
Possibility 2: ...6 - 7 - 5 - 1 - 9... (1 attached to 5).
- Costs: 5-1 (short), 1-9 (med). Replaces 5-9 (med-long). Good trade.

Winner is clearly Possibility 2.

Final path: 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3.

Formatted list:
10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3

I can start from any point. Let's start from 1 to match the "1, 5..." style of the example, although it's not required.
1, 5, 7, 6, 3, 10, 4, 2, 8, 9

Let's re-verify the labels on the image.
Leftmost cluster: 10 (top), 3 (mid), 6 (low), 7 (bottom).
Rightmost: 8 (top), 9 (low).
Center/Top: 4, 2.
Center/Bottom: 1, 5.

Wait, looking closer at the crop 4 (point 1): Point 1 is right next to point 6.
Crop 4 shows point 6, point 1, and point 5.
Distance 1-6 is very small.
Distance 1-5 is larger than 1-6.
Distance 1-9 is larger.
My previous assessment: "5-1 is short, 1-6 is very short".
If 1-6 is the shortest edge connected to 1, we really want to use it.
If we use 1-6, and we know 6 must connect to 7, then we have **1-6-7**.
From 7, we must go to 5. **1-6-7-5**.
From 5, we go to 9. **5-9**.
From 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3.
Now we must close **3 to 1**.
Is 3-1 a reasonable edge?
Distance 3-1 is roughly equal to Distance 3-6.
Let's compare this new candidate path (Path C) vs Path A.
Path A (1 between 5 and 9): ...6-7-5-1-9... Edges: 6-7, 7-5, 5-1, 1-9.
Path C (1 attached to 6): ...3-1-6-7-5-9... Edges: 3-1, 1-6, 6-7, 7-5, 5-9.
Difference:
Path A uses: 3-6, 5-1, 1-9.
Path C uses: 3-1, 1-6, 5-9.
Comparison:
3-6 vs 3-1: 3-6 is slightly shorter (visually). 1 is a bit further right.
5-1 vs 1-6: 1-6 is shorter. (1 is extremely close to 6).
1-9 vs 5-9: 1-9 is shorter. (1 is to the left of 9, 5 is further left and down, but 5-9 spans the gap). Actually, 5, 1, 9 form a shallow triangle. 5-9 is the longest side. 1-9 is shorter.
Let's look at the vertices 3, 6, 1. Triangle 3-6-1. 3-6 is base. 1 is vertex. 1-6 is very short side. 3-1 is hypotenuse-ish. 3-1 is definitely longer than 3-6.
Let's look at vertices 5, 1, 9. 5-1 is short. 1-9 is medium. 5-9 is long.
The trade-off is:
Gain by using 1-6 instead of 5-1? (1 is closer to 6 than 5). Gain is small.
Loss by using 3-1 instead of 3-6? Loss is moderate.
Loss by using 5-9 instead of 1-9? Loss is moderate to large.

Let's re-evaluate "1 is closer to 6 than 5".
Looking at the original image:
Point 6 is at (x,y) roughly.
Point 1 is at (x + small, y).
Point 5 is at (x + small, y + med).
Distance 1-6 looks to be about half of Distance 1-5.
However, the penalty of skipping 1 in the 5-9 gap (forcing the long 5-9 edge) seems higher than the gain of the super-short 1-6 edge.
Also, the penalty of the 3-1 connection (crossing/near crossing 6) is visually unappealing. 3-1 would pass very close to 6.
Actually, 3-1 doesn't cross, but it's just longer.

Let's check one more topology: **...3-6-1-5-7...**
This breaks the 6-7-5 chain.
Edges: 3-6, 6-1, 1-5, 5-7.
Then from 7... big jump to 9? No. 7 is a corner. This topology strands 7. 7 MUST connect to 5 and 6? Or 5 and something else? No, 7 is the most bottom-left. The only neighbors are 6 (above) and 5 (right). Any other connection (7-1, 7-3, 7-9) is a massive chord across the polygon.
So the sequence **6-7-5** (or 5-7-6) is fixed.

Since **6-7-5** is fixed, 1 must be visited immediately before 6 or immediately after 5.
Case 1 (Before 6): ... -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> ...
    - Who connects to 1? Must be 3. So ...3 -> 1 -> 6...
    - Who connects to 5? Must be 9. So ...5 -> 9...
    - Total chain: ...3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9...
    - Bad links: 3-1 (longish), 5-9 (longish).
Case 2 (After 5): ... -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> ...
    - Who connects to 6? Must be 3. So ...3 -> 6...
    - Who connects to 1? Must be 9. So ...1 -> 9...
    - Total chain: ...3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9...
    - Links: 3-6 (short), 6-7 (med), 7-5 (med), 5-1 (short), 1-9 (med).
    - This avoids the long 5-9 and long 3-1.

Case 2 is unambiguously better.

So the sequence is 3, 6, 7, 5, 1, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10.
Ordering:
10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3
Or starting at 1:
1, 5, 7, 6, 3, 10, 4, 2, 8, 9

Let's just do a sanity check on the upper part.
10-4-2-8 is the rim.
Could we do 10-2-4-8? 10-2 crosses 4. No.
Could we do 4-8-2? 4-8 crosses 2. No.
The top rim 10-4-2-8 is optimal.
Connection 8-9 is optimal.
Connection 3-10 is optimal.

The only question was the bottom cluster 6,7,5,1,9.
My analysis holds. The path traces the perimeter 3-6-7-5 and then tucks in to 1 before going to 9.
This maximizes the use of nearest neighbors (5-1, 3-6) and avoids long diagonals.

Final Sequence: 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6, 3

I will provide the answer starting with 10 for clarity, or just a generic start. The prompt example starts with 1. I'll check if there's a convention. No, "You can start from any point". I'll start with 10 as it's the top-leftmost usually used in reading. Or 1 because it's the number 1. I'll provide the list starting from 1.

Sequence: 1, 5, 7, 6, 3, 10, 4, 2, 8, 9

Let me double check the 1->5 vs 1->6 distances again on the full image.
Full image:
1 is located at approx x=480, y=530
6 is located at approx x=410, y=510
5 is located at approx x=470, y=900
Wait, 5 is WAY down. 1 is "1".
Let's look at the labels again.
Label 1 is next to the dot at the center.
Label 5 is next to the dot at the bottom center.
Label 6 is next to the dot left of center.
Label 7 is next to the dot at bottom left.
Visually:
Distance 1 to 6: They are horizontally adjacent. Distance looks like ~60-70 pixels.
Distance 1 to 5: They are vertically separated. Distance looks like ~370 pixels.
Whoa, my previous "short" assessment for 1-5 was wrong?
Let's look at the crop again.
Crop 4: Shows 6, 1, 5.
1 and 6 are close.
5 is far below.
7 is far below-left.
This changes things significantly.

Recalculating distances based on visual inspection of global layout:
- 1 is very close to 6. (Priority connection!)
- 1 is roughly equidistant to 3 and 9? No, 3 is closer. 9 is further right.
- 5 is far south. 7 is far south-west.
- 5 and 7 are a bottom pair.
- 5 is closer to 1 than 5 is to 9?
- 9 is far right.
- 2 is far up-right.

Let's re-evaluate the path based on "1 is close to 6".
We really want to include the edge **1-6**.
Neighbors of 6: 1, 3, 7.
Neighbors of 1: 6, 3, 5, 9.
If we use 1-6, the path segment is ...x - 1 - 6 - y... or ...x - 6 - 1 - y...
Since 6 is "outer" relative to 1 (1 is more central), usually 1 is the visited point "on the way".
However, 6 is left of 1.
Let's look at the "hull". The hull vertices are 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 5, 7, 3? Or is 6 on the hull?
If we draw a rubber band around the pins: 10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 5, 7, 6 (maybe), 3.
1 is clearly strictly inside the hull formed by 3-6-5-9.
Therefore, 1 must be inserted into the loop.
Where is the cheapest insertion for 1?
Candidates edges to break:
1.  **3-6**: Break 3-6, insert 1. Path: 3-1-6. Cost: (3-1 + 1-6) - 3-6.
    - 1 is close to 6. 3 is above 6. 3-1 is hypotenuse. 3-6 is leg.
    - Added cost is approximately (dist 1-6).
2.  **6-7**: Break 6-7, insert 1. Path: 6-1-7. Cost: (6-1 + 1-7) - 6-7.
    - 1 is far from 7. Bad idea.
3.  **5-9**: Break 5-9, insert 1. Path: 5-1-9. Cost: (5-1 + 1-9) - 5-9.
    - 1 is "on the way" between 5 and 9?
    - 5 is bottom. 9 is right. 1 is center.
    - Triangle 5-1-9. Is angle 5-1-9 obtuse? If 1 is close to the line segment 5-9, the cost is low.
    - Visual check: Line 5-9 passes below 1. 1 is "above" the line. It's a detour.
4.  **6-5**: If 6 connected to 5 (skipping 7?), no, 7 is a corner.
5.  **3-10**: Break 3-10... no, too far.

Comparison of insertions:
- **Into 3-6 (Result: 3-1-6)**: Uses the very short edge 1-6. Creates edge 3-1. Removes 3-6.
    - Visual geometry: 3, 6, 1 form a tight triangle. 1-6 is small base. 3 is apex.
    - Detour cost is small.
    - Resulting path: ...10-3-1-6-7-5-9-8...
    - Let's check the links.
    - 3-1: OK.
    - 1-6: Very Short.
    - 6-7: OK (but 6 is pulled towards 1, does that make 6-7 longer? No, 6 is fixed).
    - 7-5: OK.
    - 5-9: Long.
    - 9-8: OK.
- **Into 5-9 (Result: 5-1-9)**:
    - Resulting path: ...10-3-6-7-5-1-9-8...
    - Uses 5-1 (Med) and 1-9 (Med). Removes 5-9 (Long).
    - Basically replaces one long edge with two medium edges.
    - Does this justify missing the 1-6 connection?
    - In the "Into 3-6" scenario, we keep the long 5-9 edge.
    - In the "Into 5-9" scenario, we break the long 5-9 edge.
    - Breaking a long edge is usually the primary strategy in TSP.
    - Let's compare the total perimeters.
    - Path A (Break 3-6): Keep 5-9 (Long). Add detour at 3-6.
    - Path B (Break 5-9): Remove 5-9 (Long). Add detour at 5-9.
    - Path B seems better because it eliminates the longest edge in the southern hemisphere of the graph. The edge 5-9 is a large diagonal jump. By stopping at 1, you bridge the gap. 5->1 is a significant vertical travel, and 1->9 is horizontal. 5->9 is the hypotenuse.
    - Wait, 5-1-9 triangle: 5 is (470, 900), 1 is (480, 530), 9 is (750, 580).
        - dist(5,1) = sqrt(10^2 + 370^2) ≈ 370.
        - dist(1,9) = sqrt(270^2 + 50^2) ≈ 275.
        - dist(5,9) = sqrt(280^2 + 320^2) ≈ 425.
        - Path via 1: 370 + 275 = 645.
        - Direct path: 425.
        - Detour cost = 220 pixels.
    - Now consider inserting into 3-6.
        - 3 is approx (380, 380). 6 is (410, 510). 1 is (480, 530).
        - dist(3,6) = sqrt(30^2 + 130^2) ≈ 133.
        - dist(3,1) = sqrt(100^2 + 150^2) ≈ 180.
        - dist(1,6) = sqrt(70^2 + 20^2) ≈ 73.
        - Path via 1: 180 + 73 = 253.
        - Direct path: 133.
        - Detour cost = 120 pixels.
    - Comparing Detour Costs:
        - Insert at 3-6 cost: ~120.
        - Insert at 5-9 cost: ~220.
    - This suggests inserting at 3-6 is better!
    - **Wait**, if I insert at 3-6, I am stuck with the edge 5-9 (length 425).
    - If I insert at 5-9, I remove edge 5-9? No, I replace it.
    - The logic is: Base tour is 8-2-4-10-3-6-7-5-9-8.
        - Base tour includes edge 5-9 (425).
        - Base tour includes edge 3-6 (133).
    - Modified Tour A (Insert at 3-6):
        - Remove 3-6 (-133). Add 3-1 (+180) and 1-6 (+73).
        - Net change: +120.
        - Total includes 5-9 (425).
    - Modified Tour B (Insert at 5-9):
        - Remove 5-9 (-425). Add 5-1 (+370) and 1-9 (+275).
        - Net change: +220.
        - Total includes 3-6 (133).
    - Since both are additions to the base perimeter, the smaller addition is better.
    - Therefore, **Tour A (inserting 1 between 3 and 6) is the winner.**

Let's verify this surprising result.
Path A: 10 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10.
- 10 to 3: normal.
- 3 to 1: slightly diagonal inward.
- 1 to 6: short back-track left.
- 6 to 7: down.
- 7 to 5: right.
- 5 to 9: long diagonal up-right.
- 9 to 8: up.

Path B: 10 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10.
- 5 to 1: long vertical up.
- 1 to 9: right.

Visually, Path B looks "rounder". Path A has a sharp zig-zag 3-1-6.
However, the distance calculation (rough estimation) favored A because 1 is geometrically much closer to the 3-6 cluster than to the 5-9 line.
Let's re-read the coordinates.
3 (380, 380). 6 (410, 510). 1 (480, 530).
5 (470, 900). 9 (750, 580).
Midpoint of 5-9 is roughly (610, 740). Point 1 is at (480, 530). Point 1 is nowhere near the line segment 5-9. It's way off to the side. So "inserting" 1 into 5-9 is a massive detour.
My calculation confirmed this (cost 220).
Point 1 is very close to 6. And 3 is above 6. The triangle 3-1-6 is small.
The triangle 5-1-9 is huge.
So, locally, connecting 1 to 6 and 3 makes much more sense than connecting it to 5 and 9.

But wait, is there a global rearrangement?
What if we don't follow the hull order 5-9?
What if we go 5-1-?
From 1, nearest neighbors are 6, 3, 9.
If we go 5-1-6-7... then 7 is dead end. No.
If we go 5-1-3... 3 connects to 10. 6 connects to 7. 6 and 3 are separated.
Sequence: ...7-6-?-3...
Gap between 6 and 3 must be bridged.
We can bridge with 1: 6-1-3.
Or we can bridge directly: 6-3.
If we bridge with 1 (Path A), we pay the small detour cost.
If we bridge directly (Path B), we must visit 1 elsewhere.
Where else?
Between 9 and 8? 9(750,580), 8(900, 50), 1(480, 530). Huge detour.
Between 2 and 4? No.
Between 3 and 10? No.
Between 6 and 7? 6(410,510), 7(290, 930), 1(480, 530).
    - dist(6,7) is roughly 430.
    - dist(6,1) is 73.
    - dist(1,7) is sqrt(190^2 + 400^2) ≈ 440.
    - Cost: (73 + 440) - 430 = 83.
    - This is even cheaper than 3-6 insertion!
    - Wait, 1 to 7 is 440. 6 to 7 is 430. 6 to 1 is 73.
    - Triangle 6-1-7. 6 is apex. 1 is right of 6. 7 is far below-left.
    - Angle 1-6-7 is roughly 90 degrees?
    - 6 to 1 is (70, 20). 6 to 7 is (-120, 420).
    - Dot product is negative. Angle is obtuse.
    - If angle is obtuse, inserting 1 is a detour.
    - Visually: 6->7 goes down-left. 6->1 goes right. 1->7 goes down-left-left.
    - This is a "back and forth". 6... right to 1... left-down to 7.
    - This zig-zag seems inefficient compared to 3-1-6 where 3->1 is down-right, 1->6 is left. Flow is continuous? No, 3 to 6 is down. 3 to 1 is down right. 1 to 6 is left. It's a loop-de-loop.

Let's look at the "Star" pattern. 1 is central.
Maybe 6-1-5?
Path: ...3 - 6 - 1 - 5 - 7 ...
Is this valid?
3 to 6 (Short).
6 to 1 (Very Short).
1 to 5 (Long: 370).
5 to 7 (Med-Long: ~200 horizontal).
From 7? Dead end. 7 must connect to 6.
So we cannot do 6-1-5-7. We must do 6-7.
This forces the 6-7 link.
This forces the 7-5 link.
So the chain **6-7-5** is immutable.

This leaves us with the previous conclusion:
The chain 6-7-5 exists.
We have vertices 3 (above 6) and 9 (right of 5).
We need to connect 3 to 6-7-5 to 9.
And we need to stick 1 in somewhere.
The path is 3 -> ... -> 9.
The skeleton is 3 - (connection) - 6 - 7 - 5 - (connection) - 9.
We have two spots for 1:
Spot 1: Between 3 and 6. Sequence: 3-1-6-7-5-9.
Spot 2: Between 5 and 9. Sequence: 3-6-7-5-1-9.

Let's re-compare Spot 1 and Spot 2.
Spot 1 Costs:
Edge 3-1 (180).
Edge 1-6 (73).
Edge 5-9 (425).
Sum = 678.

Spot 2 Costs:
Edge 3-6 (133).
Edge 5-1 (370).
Edge 1-9 (275).
Sum = 778.

Difference is ~100 pixels in favor of Spot 1.
Spot 1 (visiting 1 between 3 and 6) is shorter.

Let's do a sanity check on "Spot 1".
Path: ...10 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9...
This entails a sharp acute angle turn at 1. Coming from 3 (down-right), hitting 1, sharp turn left to 6. Then down to 7.
Is there any cross?
Line 3-1. Line 6-7. No intersection.
Line 1-6. No intersection.
Line 5-9.
Line 1-9? No, in this version we use 5-9.
This creates a path that "hugs" the left cluster 3-1-6 tightly.
It leaves the large gap 5-9 open.

Let's check Spot 2 again.
Path: ...3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9...
This entails a sharp turn at 5. Coming from 7 (right), hitting 5, sharp turn up to 1. Then right to 9.
The gap 5-9 is bridged by 1.
The gap 3-6 is taken directly.

Why did my intuition initially favor Spot 2?
Because visually, 5-9 is a "gap" in the convex hull, and 1 lies "between" them horizontally.
However, vertically, 1 is way off.
The distance 5-1 is large (370).
The distance 3-1 is moderate (180).
The distance 1-6 is tiny (73).
The distance saved by splitting 5-9 (425 -> 370+275 = 645) is -425 + 645 = +220 cost.
The distance saved by splitting 3-6 (133 -> 180+73 = 253) is -133 + 253 = +120 cost.
Mathematically, Spot 1 is better.

Wait, is there a third option?
Connect 1 to 9 and 1 to something else?
How about ...3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7...?
Sequence: 3-6 (133). 6-1 (73). 1-9 (275). 9-5 (425). 5-7 (200).
This uses the dreaded 9-5 edge AND adds the 1-9 edge. Total junk.

What about ...3 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6...?
Sequence: 3-1. 1-9. 9-5. 5-7. 7-6. 6-3.
This creates a cycle 6-3-1-9-5-7-6.
Edges: 6-3(133), 3-1(180), 1-9(275), 9-5(425), 5-7(200), 7-6(430).
Total: High.
Also 6-3 closes loop prematurely without visiting top 10 etc.
If we integrate top loop: ...10-3-1-9-5-7-6-(back to 10?? no)...
From 6 we must go to 10? No, 3 goes to 10.
The connections to the outer world are at 3 and 9 (or 8).
The bottom cluster is a detour from the main cycle.
Main cycle enters at 3, leaves at 9 (to 8).
Internal path must cover {1, 5, 6, 7}.
Entrance: 3. Exit: 9.
Path endpoints: 3 and 9.
Nodes to visit: {1, 5, 6, 7}.
Constraints: 7 must connect to 5 and 6. So 5-7-6 is a block.
We treat "6-7-5" as a single super-node.
We need to go from 3 to "6-7-5" to 9, visiting 1 along the way.
Or 3 -> 1 -> "6-7-5" -> 9.
Or 3 -> "6-7-5" -> 1 -> 9.

Compare:
Path X: 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9.
   Cost: 3-1 (180) + 1-6 (73) + 6-7 (430) + 7-5 (200) + 5-9 (425).
   Relevant Sum = 180 + 73 + 425 = 678. (Excluding internal 6-7-5 which is constant).
Path Y: 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9.
   Cost: 3-6 (133) + 6-7 (430) + 7-5 (200) + 5-1 (370) + 1-9 (275).
   Relevant Sum = 133 + 370 + 275 = 778.

Path X is shorter by roughly 100 units.
Path X corresponds to:
... 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 8 ...

Let me visually re-verify 3-1 vs 5-1.
3 is at ~y=380. 1 is at ~y=530. Delta Y = 150.
5 is at ~y=900. 1 is at ~y=530. Delta Y = 370.
1 is clearly closer to 3 than to 5.
This confirms Path X is better. 1 is grouped with the northern/left cluster, not the southern cluster.

So the sequence is:
10, 4, 2, 8, 9, 5, 7, 6, 1, 3.
Wait, reverse direction of X: 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9.
So:
10, 3, 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4.

Let's check the order "10, 4, 2..." (clockwise).
10 connects to 3.
3 connects to 1.
1 connects to 6.
6 connects to 7.
7 connects to 5.
5 connects to 9.
9 connects to 8.
8 connects to 2.
2 connects to 4.
4 connects to 10.

This forms the cycle:
10, 3, 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4.
Or starting from 1:
1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3.

Let's re-verify the 9-8 vs 8-9 direction.
From 5 to 9 is good.
From 9 to 8 is good.
From 8 to 2 is good.
From 2 to 4 is good.
From 4 to 10 is good.
From 10 to 3 is good.
From 3 to 1 is good.

This looks like the winner.
My previous choice was: 1, 5, 7, 6, 3, 10...
That corresponded to 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9. (Path Y).
I have now determined Path X (3->1->6->7->5->9) is superior because 1 is much closer to 3 than to 5.

Final Answer Formulation:
Start point: 1.
Next: 6 (very close).
Next: 7 (forced).
Next: 5 (forced).
Next: 9 (closest logical step forward).
Next: 8 (up).
Next: 2 (left).
Next: 4 (left).
Next: 10 (left).
Next: 3 (down).
Return to 1.

The list: 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3.

Wait, looking at the image one last time.
Does 3-1 cross 10-something?
3-1 goes down-right.
10-3 is the incoming edge.
No crossing.
Does 1-6 cross 7-something?
1-6 goes left. 7 is way below. No.
Does 5-9 cross anything?
5-9 goes up-right.
3-1-6 is up-left of it.
No crossing.
The loop 1-6-7-5-9-8-2-4-10-3-1 is simple and non-intersecting.

Is there any concern about 5-9 being "too long"?
Is there an alternative to 5-9?
Maybe 5-1-? No, 1 is visited.
Maybe 5-3? Crosses everything.
Maybe 5-8? Crosses everything.
Maybe 7-9? Crosses 5.
No, 5-9 is the necessary bridge to close the loop on the right side.
The only way to avoid 5-9 is to route via 1, which we analyzed (Path Y) and found to be longer due to vertical distance.

One subtle check: What about ...3-6-1-5-9...?
I evaluated this as Spot 1 with a twist: 3-6 (keep), 6-1 (add), 1-5 (add), 5-9 (keep).
Wait, path is 3->6->1->5->9.
Edges: 3-6 (133), 6-1 (73), 1-5 (370), 5-9 (425).
Total = 1001.
Path X (3-1-6-7-5-9): 3-1(180)+1-6(73)+6-7(430)+7-5(200)+5-9(425).
Sum = 1308. (This includes the 6-7-5 loop cost).
Path Y (3-6-7-5-1-9): 3-6(133)+6-7(430)+7-5(200)+5-1(370)+1-9(275).
Sum = 1408.

Wait, I need to be careful comparing the topologies.
Topology X: ...3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9...
Topology Y: ...3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9...
Topology Z: ...3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7... (Bad, 1 far from 7).
Topology W: ...3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5... (Bad, skips 7, 7 becomes dead end).

So it is strictly between X and Y.
X Sum = 678 + const(6-7-5).
Y Sum = 778 + const(6-7-5).
X is better.
Path X: 3, 1, 6, 7, 5, 9.

One Visual Check on 1-5 distance vs 3-1 distance.
Use the digit "1" height as a ruler. Digit height ~15px.
1 to 3 distance: ~10 digit heights. (150px).
1 to 5 distance: ~20 digit heights. (300px).
1 to 6 distance: ~4 digit heights. (60px).
1 to 9 distance: ~15 digit heights. (225px).
3 to 6 distance: ~8 digit heights. (120px).
5 to 9 distance: ~25 digit heights. (375px).

Let's re-run the math with these estimates.
Path X (3-1-6-7-5-9):
   3-1 (150) + 1-6 (60) + 5-9 (375).
   Cost = 150 + 60 + 375 = 585.
Path Y (3-6-7-5-1-9):
   3-6 (120) + 5-1 (300) + 1-9 (225).
   Cost = 120 + 300 + 225 = 645.

585 < 645.
Path X wins again. The visual estimates confirm 1 is significantly closer to the top cluster (3, 6) than the bottom cluster (5). The "gap" 5-9 is large, but bridging it via 1 is an expensive detour north.

The list should be: 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3.

Final output format:
List starting from 1.
1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3.

Wait, let me start at 8 just to follow the numeric order if possible or something standard.
8, 2, 4, 10, 3, 1, 6, 7, 5, 9
This reads nicely.
Or 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3.
The prompt example started with 1. I will start with 1.

One oddity: 5-9-8 vs 5-9-1...
Is it 9-8 or 9-2?
9 is far right. 8 is top right corner.
9 to 8 is the perimeter.
8 connects to 2.
2 connects to 4.
4 connects to 10.
10 connects to 3.
This part is solid.

The solid path is 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3.

Final check on crossing.
3-1 vs 10-4? No.
3-1 vs 2-8? No.
1-6 vs 7-5? No.
6-7 vs 1-5? (If I did 1-5).
Path X uses 3-1, 1-6, 6-7.
3(380,380) -> 1(480,530) -> 6(410,510) -> 7(290,930).
3->1 is down-right.
1->6 is left.
6->7 is down-left.
Wait, 1 is (480, 530). 6 is (410, 510).
Y of 1 (530) is below Y of 6 (510).
So 1->6 is Up-Left.
3->1 is Down-Right.
So 3->1 and 1->6 form a "V" shape. No self intersection.
6->7 is Down-Left.
Does 3->1 cross 6->7?
3 is (380,380). 1 is (480,530).
6 is (410,510). 7 is (290,930).
Line 3-1 equation: goes right 100, down 150. Slope 1.5.
Line 6-7 equation: goes left 120, down 420. Slope roughly -3.5 (but x decreases).
Visually, 3 is above 6. 1 is right of 6.
3-1 passes to the right of 6.
6-7 goes left from 6.
They diverge. No intersection.

Everything seems correct.

Answer: 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 10, 3
