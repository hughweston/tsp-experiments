To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I will identify the shortest path by visually tracing the nearest neighbors to form a closed loop without crossing lines.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Starting at the top right cluster, we can begin with **11**.
2.  The closest point downwards is **1**.
3.  From 1, the nearest neighbor is **9**.
4.  Next is **7**, which is very close to 9.
5.  Moving slightly down is **13**.
6.  To the right of 13 is **2**.
7.  From 2, going down leads to **12**.
8.  From 12, we move left to **10**.
9.  Continuing left and down to the bottom, the next point is **5**.
10. Moving upwards and left from 5, we hit **3**.
11. Just above 3 is **6**.
12. Continuing upwards, we reach **4**.
13. Nearby is **14**.
14. To the left is **15**.
15. Finally, the topmost point on the left is **8**, which would connect back across to 11 to close the loop.

**Tour:**
11, 1, 9, 7, 13, 2, 12, 10, 5, 3, 6, 4, 14, 15, 8
