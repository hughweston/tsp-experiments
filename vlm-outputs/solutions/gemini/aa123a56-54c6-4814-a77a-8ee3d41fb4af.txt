To find the shortest tour for the Traveling Salesman Problem shown in the image, I will visually trace the most logical path that connects nearest neighbors without creating large jumps or crossing lines unnecessarily.

Here is the step-by-step path I will construct:

1.  **Start at the bottom left:** Point **16** is isolated. The nearest point to it is far away, likely in the upper cluster.
2.  **Move to the upper left cluster:** The closest points to 16 appear to be the group of 2, 9, 17. Let's connect **16 -> 2**.
3.  **Traverse the left cluster:** From **2**, go to **17**, then to **9**. From 9, the next logical step is towards the top. So: **2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10**.
4.  **Move rightwards:** From **10**, move slightly down and right to the pair 5 and 19. The order is **10 -> 5 -> 19**.
5.  **Cross the gap to the right cluster:** From **19**, the nearest points are in the upper right. Point 11 is a good entry. Let's go **19 -> 11**.
6.  **Traverse the upper right:** From **11**, go to **14**, then down to **20**. So: **11 -> 14 -> 20**.
7.  **Move down the right side:** From **20**, the next closest is **8**.
8.  **Go towards the middle:** From **8**, move inwards to the line of points: **13**, then **3**, then **4**. Wait, 4 is higher up near 11. Let's re-evaluate that section.
    *   Alternative for step 5/6: From 19, go to 4. Then 11, 14, 20.
    *   Let's trace: **19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3**. This looks smoother.
9.  **Move to the lower central group:** From **3**, go to **1**, then the pair 7 and 12. So: **3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
10. **Head to the bottom right:** From **12**, the tour needs to go to the bottom right corner (15, 6, 18) and then somehow loop back to 16? Ah, the tour is a cycle. Let's see.
    *   From **12**, go to **15**.
    *   From **15**, go to **18**.
    *   From **18**, go to **6**.
    *   From **6**, we need to close the loop. But 6 is very far from 16.
    *   Let's re-examine the global structure. It looks like a "U" shape or a large circle.
    *   Left side (16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19).
    *   Top/Right side (4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 13, 3).
    *   Bottom/Middle side (1, 7, 12, 15, 18, 6).
    *   The gap between 6 and 16 is huge. The gap between 12 and 15 is moderate.
    *   Maybe the connection is **12 -> 16**? No, that crosses the whole map.
    *   Let's look at the connections again. The connection **16 -> 12** seems plausible as a long edge to close the loop if we traverse counter-clockwise.

Let's try a different order starting from the dense middle to minimize crossings:
*   Start at **16**. Go to **17**, then **2**, then **9**, then **10**, then **5**, then **19**. (This clears the left side).
*   From **19**, go to **4**, then **11**, then **14**, then **20**. (Top right corner).
*   From **20**, go down to **8**, then **13**, then **3**. (Middle right).
*   From **3**, go to **1**, then **7**, then **12**. (Center).
*   Now we have the bottom right group (15, 6, 18) and the start (16).
*   From **12**, go to **15**.
*   From **15**, go to **18**, then **6**.
*   This leaves a very long return edge **6 -> 16**.

Is there a better way to handle the bottom right?
Maybe **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15**? Then from 15 to... 1?
Let's try: **20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13** (bad cross) -> **3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
From 12, the long jump to 16 is unavoidable if 16 is an endpoint of a chain.
But wait, look at **12** and **16**. They are somewhat aligned at the bottom. The distance isn't *terrible*.

Let's refine the right side:
**20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14**? No, 4 is closer to 11.
The cluster 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 13, 3 forms a distinct group.
The path **4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3** seems optimal for that cluster.

Connection from Left to Right:
**19** is closest to **4**. So **...-> 19 -> 4 -> ...**

Connection from Right to Bottom/Center:
From **3**, the closest is **1**. So **...-> 3 -> 1**.
From **1**, closest is **7**, then **12**. So **1 -> 7 -> 12**.

Connection from Center to Bottom Right:
From **12**, go to **15**. Then **18**, then **6**.
Is there a better way? Maybe **12 -> 15 -> 6 -> 18**? No, 15-18-6 is a tight triangle. 15 is closest to 18. 18 is close to 6.
So **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
Now we are stuck at 6. The return to 16 is massive.

Let's reconsider the start.
Maybe **16 -> 12**?
**16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> ...** where do we go from 2? We are stuck.

Let's look at the gap between **6** and the rest. **6** is near **8**.
Maybe the path goes **20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13**?
Let's check distances visually.
8 to 6 is quite far.
8 to 13 is closer.
13 to 15 is quite far.

Let's look at **3** and **13**. **3** is very close to **13**.
Let's look at **3** and **1**. They are close.
Let's look at **1** and **7**. Very close.

Let's try to weave the bottom right in differently.
Maybe **13 -> 15**? It's a jump, but maybe necessary.
Path: **...8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1...**
This puts 6, 18, 15 as an extension of the right side.
Let's trace:
Start **16**.
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19**. (Left loop done).
From **19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**. (Top right done).
From **20**, go **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15**. (This captures the bottom right corner).
From **15**, go to **13**? It's a bit of a stretch but plausible.
From **13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
From **12**, long return to **16**.

Is there a shorter return?
What if the order at the bottom is different?
**16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Let's check the **2 -> 16** link. It's close.
Let's check **16 -> 12**. It's a long jump across the bottom.
Let's check **13 -> 15**. Moderate jump.
Let's check **6 -> 8**. Moderate jump.

Can we improve **16 -> 12**?
What if we connect **16 -> 17**? (Close).
**16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 2 -> 16**.
Let's check **12 -> 2**. That is a VERY long cross. Bad.

Let's try to bridge the bottom gap differently.
**16** is closest to **2**.
**12** is closest to **7**.
**15** is somewhat isolated.
Maybe the loop goes through the middle.
**...19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19...**
Jumps to check:
1. **2 -> 16**: Good.
2. **16 -> 12**: Long.
3. **13 -> 15**: Medium-Long.
4. **6 -> 8**: Medium-Long.
5. **4 -> 19**: Medium.

Is there a way to avoid **16 -> 12**?
Maybe **16 -> 15**? No, huge.
Maybe **2 -> 12**? No.

Let's look at **12**. Neighbors are **7** and **1**.
What about **12 -> 15**? Yes, that's visually quite close! Much closer than 13->15.
Let's reconstruct with **12 -> 15**.
Path: **...7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6...**
From **6**, where to? **8** is the logical choice.
From **8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11**.
From **11**, where? **4**.
From **4**, go left to **19**.
**19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17**.
From **17**, go to **2**.
From **2**, go to **16**.
Now we are at **16**. We need to get back to the start of the chain (around 7/1).
The start was **...-> 1 -> 7**.
So we need a link from **16 -> 1**. That is a huge cross.

Let's try to spiral.
Start **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
Now we are at **13**. We need to close to **16**.
**13 -> 16** is a massive diagonal cross. Bad.

Let's look at the neighbors of **13**. **3**, **8**, **15**.
Neighbors of **3**: **1**, **13**, **4**.
Neighbors of **4**: **19**, **11**, **3**.

Let's try this sequence:
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 4**.
Wait, **19 -> 11** is okay.
**4** is left stranded at the end.
Close loop **4 -> 16**? Huge cross.

Let's go back to the idea of two main clusters (left and right) connected by bridges.
Bridge 1: **19 -> 4** (or 11).
Bridge 2: **1 -> 7** (Center).
Bridge 3: **16** to **12**?
Actually, **16** is very far from the center. It is really just an extension of the left cluster.
So the sequence **16-2-17** is almost certainly correct.
The sequence **12-7-1-3-13** is a strong central backbone.
The sequence **15-18-6** is a strong corner.
The sequence **12-15** connects center to corner.
The sequence **6-8** connects corner to upper right.
The sequence **8-20-14-11** is the upper right edge.
Now, how do **4**, **19**, and the left cluster fit in?
**11 -> 4** is close.
**4 -> 19** is the natural bridge to the left.
**19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Now we are at **16**. We need to close the loop back to the start of this chain.
If we started at **12**, the chain was **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
The missing link to close is **16 -> 12**.
As observed before, this is a long straight line across the empty bottom space.
Is there ANY shorter link?
Let's check **16 -> 6**? No.
Let's check **16 -> 15**? No.
Let's check **2 -> 1**? No.
Let's check **17 -> 1**? No.
Let's check **13 -> 19**? No.
Let's check **3 -> 4**? **3** and **4** are neighbors.
Let's try breaking the loop at **3-4**.
Path: ...**3 -> 4 -> 11**...
Then where does **13** go? **13 -> 8**...
Let's re-route the middle right.
**1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Now from **16**, we must jump somewhere. **16 -> 12** is the only candidate that doesn't cut through the middle of the graph.
From **12 -> 7**. (Start was 1).
So **...16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1**.
Let's see the rest of the loop from **12**.
**12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13**...
Wait, from **13**, we need to get to **3** (to connect to 1). Or get to **20**.
If we go **8 -> 13 -> 20**... no **13-20** is bad. **13-8** is good.
So **6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16 -> (back to 12 via long jump)**.
Let's trace the full loop:
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
From **12**, close to **16**.
Let's look at **15 -> 13**. Is that good?
**15** is bottom rightish. **13** is mid-right. It's an open space jump but no points in between.
Let's look at **8 -> 6**.
The previous path had **6 -> 8**.
This path has **20 -> 8 -> 6**.
Let's compare **8-6** vs **8-13**.
**8** is closer to **13**. **6** is further.
However, if we do **8 -> 13**, how do we pick up **6, 18, 15**?
We could do **13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
Then from **6**, we are at a dead end. We'd have to jump to **12** or something. **6 -> 12** is far.
So the "scoop" **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8** seems the most efficient way to clear that corner.
Let's lock that in: **12-15-18-6-8**.

Now from **8**:
Go up: **8 -> 13 -> 3 -> ?**
Or **8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11**.
Let's try **8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11**.
From **11**, we have **4**.
From **4**, we have **3**.
From **3**, we have **13**.
From **13**... stuck.
This implies **13** should be visited near **8** or **3**.
Points around **13**: **8**, **3**, **20** (far), **4** (med).
Best edges for **13**: **13-8** and **13-3**.
So the path segment **8-13-3** (or **3-13-8**) is highly likely.

Let's integrate **8-13-3** with the corner scoop **12-15-18-6-8**.
This doesn't work well because 8 is the connector to the corner.
Maybe **6-8-13-3**?
Let's try: **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3**.
From **3**, go to **1**.
From **1**, go to **7**. (Wait, 12-7 are neighbors, we shouldn't separate them too much).
Ideally **12-7-1**.
So: **15-18-6-8-13-3-1-7-12**.
This forms a nice loop for the bottom/right.
Now where to attach the top/left?
We have open ends at **12** (which goes to 15) and **3** (which goes to 13). Or **1** and **7**.
Wait, the sequence above is a cycle itself if we close 12-15.
We need to break this cycle to insert the rest.
Best places to break:
Between **3** and **1**? No, tight.
Between **8** and **13**? No, tight.
Between **8** and **6**? Distance is medium.
Between **20** and ... wait **20** isn't in there yet.

Let's add the top group: **20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16**.
Connection points:
**20** is near **8** and **14**.
**4** is near **3**, **11**, **19**.

Let's try inserting the top group between **8** and **3**?
**...6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16...**
Now we are at **16**. We need to get back to **13** or **3**.
**16** is bottom left. **3** is mid right. Terrible.

Let's try inserting between **1** and **7**?
**...3 -> 1 -> (top group) -> 7 -> 12...**
**1** is near **12** and **7**. No obvious connection to top group except maybe **4**?
**1 -> 4** is a bit of a jump but crosses **3-13**.
Let's look at **4**. It's the hub between left, top-right, and bottom-right.
Neighbors of **4**: **11**, **19**, **3**.
So the path likely goes through **4** to switch regions.
Possibility A: **19 -> 4 -> 11**.
Possibility B: **19 -> 4 -> 3**.

Let's build a path using **19 -> 4 -> 3**.
Start **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 3**.
From **3**, go to **13 -> 8**.
From **8**, go to **20 -> 14 -> 11**.
From **11**, we are stuck at the top.
So **4** should connect to **11**.
**19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**. (Left chain).
Let's attach at **19**.
**...11 -> 4 -> 19...**
So right side -> **11**. Left side -> **19**.
Right side chain: **...20 -> 14 -> 11**.
Where does it come from?
**13 -> 8 -> 20**? **8-20** is a bit far but clear.
**3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Now we are at **16**.
We have the bottom center/right remaining: **1, 7, 12, 15, 18, 6**.
We ended at **16**. We need to connect to this group.
Connection **16 -> 12** (long jump).
Chain: **12 -> 7 -> 1**.
From **1**, connect to **3** (start of the other chain). **1 -> 3** is very close.
Let's check the missing link: **6**.
We have **15, 18, 6**.
Where to fit them?
Between **12** and **1**? No.
Attached to **12**? **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
From **6**, connect to **8**?
Let's re-verify the **8** connections.
Previous: **13 -> 8 -> 20**.
New proposal: **...6 -> 8 -> 20...**
So path: **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
From **16**, jump to **7**? Or **12**?
**16 -> 12** closes the loop. But we missed **1, 7, 3, 13**.
Let's insert them.
Where is **1, 7**? Between **12** and **3**?
Actually, **12** is near **7**. **7** is near **1**. **1** is near **3**. **3** is near **13**. **13** is near **8**.
This is a perfect chain: **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8**.
Let's combine this with the rest.
**...15 -> 18 -> 6**.
Connect **6** to **12**? No, far.
Connect **6** to **8**? Yes, reasonable gap.
But **8** is the end of the chain coming from **12**.
So: **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15**.
From **15**, go to **16**? Huge jump.
From **15**, go to **12**? Closed loop. We missed the top.
The top connects at **8** (to 20) or **4** (to 19) or **3** (to 4).
Let's try connecting at **8**.
**...13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19...**
So chain: **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Now we have **16** at one end, **12** at the other.
But we missed **6, 18, 15**.
Where do they go?
They are a diverticulum off the bottom right.
Closest points to that cluster are **12** (to 15) and **8** (to 6).
So we must route through them.
Instead of **13->8->20**, go **13 -> ?**
Or instead of **12->7**, go **12->15**.
Let's try: **7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16 -> (long jump) -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> (jump back to start 7?)**.
**6 -> 7** is a diagonal cross.
**6 -> 8** is a better connection, but we already visited 8.
This means the sequence **12-15-18-6-8** is likely optimal.
Let's build around that.
**12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8**.
From **8**, go to **20 -> 14 -> 11**.
From **11**, go to **4**.
From **4**, go to **19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
From **16**, long jump to **7**. (Is 16-7 better than 16-12? Visually similar).
From **7**, go to **1 -> 3 -> 13**.
From **13**, we need to close to **12**.
**13 -> 12** is a cross through 7/1. Not ideal.
Is there a link from **13 -> 8**? Yes, but we started at 12->...->8.
Ah, **13** is near **8**.
Let's reverse the start.
**...16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
Now close **13 -> 16**. BAD.

Let's reconsider the **4** junction.
**4** connects to **3** and **11**.
Maybe **...11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 4 -> 19...**
This puts the whole right block in one line.
Let's try this path:
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> (return to 16)**.
Return **6 -> 16** is huge.

What if we run the bottom right differently?
**...7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8...**
What if we come down from the top?
**...20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13...**
Now **13** is the end. Needs to go to **14**? No, 14 is top right.
**13** is near **3**. **3** is near **4**.
Let's try: **...20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8...**
This creates a small loop 8-13-3-4-11-14-20-8.
We need to linearize it.
**...19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
From **13**, where?
Maybe **13 -> 16**? No.
Maybe **13** connects to **20**? No.

Let's look at the "Gap" again.
The largest mandatory gaps seem to be:
1. **16** to **12** (or 7).
2. **6** to **8** (or 13/20).
3. **19** to **4** (or 11).

Is it possible **16** connects to **6**?
Straight line at the bottom. **16**...**6**. No, **18** and **15** are in the way.
The sequence **16 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6** travels left to right along the bottom.
So **16** connects to **12**.
Let's assume **16-12** is a valid edge.
Path: **16 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
From **6**, go to **8**.
From **8**, go to **13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7**.
Wait, **7** is stranded near **12** and **1**.
If we do **16 -> 12**, **7** must be handled.
Maybe **16 -> 7 -> 12**? No, **7** is "above" **12**.
Maybe **16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8**.
From **8**, go **6**? No, we need to visit 6 before.
This is getting tangled.

Let's try the "Circle" approach.
Imagine a convex hull.
Points on hull: **16, 2, 9, 10, 19, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 12**.
(Maybe 17, 5, 4, 13, 3, 1, 7 are interior).
Let's try to follow the hull and dip in.
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14** (zig zag?)
Better: **19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 13 -> 8 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
From **6**, long return to **16**.

Let's check the **3-13-8** triangle again.
**8** is clearly next to **20**.
**13** is between **8** and **3**.
**3** is next to **1**.
So **20-8-13-3-1** is a strong sequence.
Let's check the bottom.
**1** is next to **7**. **7** next to **12**. **12** next to **15**.
So **1-7-12-15**.
**15** next to **18**. **18** next to **6**.
So **1-7-12-15-18-6**.
Now we have an end at **6**.
And the other end at **20**.
Top part: **20** connects to **14**, then **11**.
**11** connects to **4**.
**4** connects to **19**.
**19** connects to **5**, then **10**, **9**, **17**, **2**, **16**.
So we have a chain **6...16**.
**6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
This covers everything.
Now, is **16 -> 6** a good closing edge?
It is a very long straight line along the bottom.
Is there a better closing edge?
Let's check the other option:
Reverse the bottom right segment?
**...1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3...** (Problem: 1 connects to 3, forming a loop excluding the rest).

Let's try to connect **16** to **12** again.
**16 -> 12**.
Then **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> (back to 16)**.
We missed **6, 18, 15**.
Where to insert them?
Near **12** or **8**.
If near **12**: **16 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8?** No, then how do we get back to **7**?
**16 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> (jump to 7) -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> ...**
**6 -> 7** is a cross.
Maybe **16 -> 2... -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 16**?
**13 -> 16** is bad.

What about **15 -> 13**?
**...12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20...**
**3 -> 13** is good. **13 -> 15** is a jump across the "bay". **15 -> 18 -> 6** is tight. **6 -> 8** is a jump back.
This leaves the path as:
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16**.
Let's evaluate the jumps:
1. **16-2**: Good.
2. **19-4**: Good.
3. **4-11**: Good.
4. **20-8**: Good.
5. **8-6**: Medium/Long (Vertical).
6. **15-13**: Medium/Long (Vertical).
7. **12-16**: Long (Horizontal).

Compare with:
**16 -> 2 -> ... -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 16**.
Jumps:
1. **20-8**: Good.
2. **8-13**: Good.
3. **12-15**: Good.
4. **6-16**: Very Long (Horizontal).

Let's look at **6 -> 16** vs **12 -> 16**.
**12** is at coordinate roughly (12, 5). **16** is (2, 2).
**6** is at coordinate roughly (20, 3). **16** is (2, 2).
So **6 -> 16** is length ~18.
**12 -> 16** is length ~10.
So **12 -> 16** is much better.
This suggests the tour should start/end on the **16-12** link.

So we assume the link **16-12** exists.
Path starts **16**, ends **12**.
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
Does this work?
**8 -> 6**: jump down.
**15 -> 13**: jump up.
This creates a zig-zag on the right side.
Alternative:
**16 -> ... -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> (cross to 19?)** No.

Let's look closely at **4**.
**4** is between **19** and **11**. Also near **3**.
Is it **19-4-3** or **19-4-11**?
If **19-4-3**: **...19 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> ...** (dead end at 11).
If **11** is end, we need to close to **16**. **11 -> 16** is huge.
So **4** must link **19** and **11**.

So sequence is **19-4-11** (or reverse).
This implies **19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16** is one block.
And **11 -> 14 -> 20...** is the other.
So we have two main strands meeting at **16-12**.
**Strand 1 (Left):** **12 -> 16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
Now we are at **20**. We need to get back to **12** covering the bottom right.
Remaining points: **8, 13, 3, 1, 7, 15, 18, 6**.
Current position: **20**. Target: **12**.
Path: **20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> (gap) -> 12**.
But we missed **15, 18, 6**.
Insert them.
Between **7** and **12**? **7 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12**.
**7 -> 6** is a long cross.
Between **8** and **13**? **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13**.
**8 -> 6** (med). **15 -> 13** (med).
This looks like the most viable option again.

Let's try to optimize the right side block: **20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3, 1, 7**.
Entry: **20**. Exit: **7** (to go to 12).
**20 -> 8**.
From **8**, do we go **13** or **6**?
If **8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
End at **6**. Return to **16** (long).
If **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
End at **13**. Return to **20** (loop)? No we came from 20.
We need to connect **13** to the left block? **13 -> 4**?
**13** is somewhat near **4**.
Let's check **13-4**.
Points: **13**, **4**. Distance is moderate.
Points: **3**, **4**. Distance is short.
So maybe the bridge is at **3-4**?
Let's try:
Left Block: **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4**.
Right Block: **3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13**.
Top Block: **11 -> 14 -> 20**.
Connect them.
**4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8**. (This works well).
From **8**, where? **6** or **13**.
If **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
Now we are at **13**. Close to **16**? No.
We need to close the loop.
Start **16**.
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
Closing link **13 -> 16**.
This is a cross of the entire graph.

Let's look at **15 -> 13** vs **15 -> 12**.
**15** is much closer to **12**.
So **...12 -> 15...** is almost certainly a segment.
Also **15-18-6** is a tight group.
So **12-15-18-6** is a unit.
From **6**, closest is **8**.
From **8**, closest are **20** and **13**.
From **20**, closest is **14**. **14 -> 11**. **11 -> 4**.
So **...6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4...**
From **4**, closest are **19** and **3**.
If we go **4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
From **16**, we must close to the start of the chain.
If the chain started at **12**: **12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Closing link: **16 -> 12**.
We missed **13, 3, 1, 7**.
They are a loop in the middle.
We need to stitch them in.
**4** is near **3**.
**1** is near **7**. **7** is near **12**.
So we can divert from **4** or **12**.
Divert from **4**: **4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8**. (Skips **1, 7**).
Divert from **12**: **16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> (jump to 8?) -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> (back to 12?)**.
Let's try: **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> (jump back to 16?)**.
Closing link **6 -> 16**.
This path visits every node.
Let's evaluate the jump **8 -> 13** vs **8 -> 6**.
**8 -> 13** is short.
**13 -> 3** is short.
**3 -> 1** is short.
**1 -> 7** is short.
**7 -> 12** is short.
**12 -> 15** is short.
**15 -> 18** is short.
**18 -> 6** is short.
**6 -> 16** is VERY LONG.

Can we fix the closing link?
Maybe we don't end at 6.
Maybe **6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18** (stuck).

Let's look at the **16 -> 12** link again. It's the only reasonable way to close the bottom if we don't cross the middle.
Assume **16-12** is fixed.
We need a path from **12** to **16** visiting all others.
**12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15**.
Now we are at **15**. Jump to **20**? No.
Jump to **13**? Already visited.
This dead-ends at the bottom right.
So the bottom right loop **12-15-18-6-8-13-3-1-7-12** is a problem because it's hard to enter/exit.
It needs to be cut.
Cut at **8-20**?
**20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
End at **13**.
Start at **20**.
Previous chain ending at **20**: **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
Path so far: **16...20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13**.
Closing link: **13 -> 16**. (Bad).

Is there a cut between **3** and **4**?
**16...19 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13**.
End **13**.
We missed **11, 14, 20**.
Insert them.
**13 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11**.
End **11**.
Closing link **11 -> 16**. (Bad).

Let's try **11** connecting to **4**.
**...11 -> 4 -> 19...**
So **4** is the gateway.
If we come from **3**: **3 -> 4 -> 19**.
Then **11** must be attached to **14, 20**.
**20 -> 14 -> 11**.
Where does **20** attach? **8** or **13**.
**8 -> 20**.
So path segment: **...8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11...**
But **11** is near **4**.
So **11 -> 4**.
And **4** is near **3** and **19**.
So **...8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19...** (skips 3, 13).
Or **...8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13...** (loops back).

Okay, let's look at the labels and positions one last time.
**16** (bottom left)
**2** (above 16)
**17** (left of 2)
**9** (above 2)
**10** (top left)
**5** (below 10)
**19** (right of 5)
**4** (right of 19)
**11** (above 4)
**14** (top right)
**20** (below 14)
**8** (below 20)
**13** (left of 8)
**3** (left of 13)
**1** (below 3)
**7** (right of 1, actually 1 is above 7-12)
**12** (left of 7)
**15** (bottom right)
**18** (below 6)
**6** (right of 15)

Let's trace: **16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 12, 7, 1, 3, 13, 4**.
Check the closing loop **4 -> 16**. Distance is ~20 units.
Check the internal jumps.
**19 -> 11**: Good.
**20 -> 8**: Good.
**8 -> 6**: Good.
**15 -> 12**: Good.
**13 -> 4**: Good.
This looks like a candidate. **4-16** is the only weak link.
Is **4-16** weaker than **6-16** or **12-16**?
**4** is roughly (12, 12). **16** is (2, 2). Distance ~14.
**12** is roughly (10, 5). **16** is (2, 2). Distance ~8.5.
**6** is roughly (20, 3). **16** is (2, 2). Distance ~18.
So **12 -> 16** is the best closing link.

We must end at **12** (or start at **12** and go to **16**).
Path: **12 -> 16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19**.
From **19**, go to **4**.
From **4**, go to **11 -> 14 -> 20**.
From **20**, go to **8**.
From **8**, go to **6 -> 18 -> 15**.
From **15**, go to **13**.
From **13**, go to **3 -> 1 -> 7**.
From **7**, close to **12**.
Let's check **15 -> 13** and **7 -> 12**.
**7 -> 12**: Neighbors. Good.
**15 -> 13**: Moderate jump.
**8 -> 6**: Moderate.
**4 -> 19**: Good.
This looks very solid.
Sequence: **12, 16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3, 1, 7**.
Wait, **15 -> 13**.
Let's look at **15** (bottom right) and **13** (mid right).
Is **15 -> 13** better than **15 -> 12**?
**15 -> 12** is closer.
But if we do **15 -> 12**, we close the loop prematurely or force a bad jump elsewhere.
If we do **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Close **16 -> 12**.
Edges:
**13 -> 15**: Jump.
**6 -> 8**: Jump.
**16 -> 12**: Long jump.

Is there any way to avoid **13->15**?
Maybe **13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12**.
Edges: **13 -> 8** (Good). **15 -> 12** (Good).
Sequence: **...3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12...**
Where does it connect?
**...4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
Connect **20** to **3**? **20 -> 13**?
**20** is near **8**.
Maybe **20 -> 8**. But **8** is used in **13-8-6**.
So **20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> (back to 20?)**.
**7 -> 20** is horrible.

What about **7 -> 4**?
**...1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 11...**
**7** is near **12**, **1**, **6**(kinda).
**7** is (11, 5). **4** is (12, 12). Distance 7.
**1** is (11, 7). **4** is (12, 12). Distance 5.
**1 -> 4** is a decent link.
Let's try splitting at **1-4**.
**16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13**.
End **13**. Start **16**. Bad.

How about **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
End **20**. Start **16**. Bad.

Let's reconsider the **15-13** jump.
**13** (17, 9). **15** (18, 3). Distance ~6.
**12** (10, 5). **16** (2, 2). Distance ~8.5.
These "jumps" are unavoidable to bridge the clusters.
The graph has a C-shape hole on the right. **20-8-13-15-6** edge.
The sequence **20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13** creates a crossing. **8-6** and **15-13**.
Better: **20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
**8 -> 13** (Good). **13 -> 15** (Med). **6 -> ??**
From **6**, go to **12**. **6** (20,3) -> **12** (10,5). Distance ~10.
Then **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14**.
End **14**. Start **20**. Good loop.
Remaining: **19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16**.
Attach at **4**.
**...11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
From **16**, close to where? **12**?
If we attach at **12**, we break the **6-12** link.
**...6 -> 16 -> 2...19 -> 12...**
**6 -> 16** is huge.

Let's stick to the most robust path found:
**16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Let's optimize the middle section.
**3 -> 13 -> 15**. (Crosses 8-6 line potentially? No).
**6 -> 8**.
**8 -> 20**.
This seems to follow the outer boundary nicely.
Let's check neighbors of **13**. **3**, **8**, **15**.
**3-13** is tight. **13-15** is the jump.
**15-18-6** is tight.
**6-8** is the jump back up.
**8-20** is tight.
This path traces the indentation on the right side.
Sequence: **3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20**.
This looks topologically correct.
Then **20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Then **16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3**.
This is a full cycle.
Let's verify edges again.
**16-12**: Best option for bottom closure.
**12-7**: Good.
**7-1**: Good.
**1-3**: Good.
**3-13**: Good.
**13-15**: The necessary jump.
**15-18**: Good.
**18-6**: Good.
**6-8**: The other necessary jump.
**8-20**: Good.
**20-14**: Good.
**14-11**: Good.
**11-4**: Good.
**4-19**: Good.
**19-5**: Good.
**5-10**: Good.
**10-9**: Good.
**9-17**: Good.
**17-2**: Good.
**2-16**: Good.

Is there a swap to improve?
Maybe **13-8-6-18-15**?
Then **15 -> ?**. **15 -> 12**.
Then **12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3**.
Then **3 -> 13** (loop closed).
Where does **20** go? **8 -> 20**.
**...3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11...**
But we missed **6, 18, 15**.
Branch off **8**.
**8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> (back to 8?)**
No, **13** connects to **4**?
**13 -> 4 -> 19... -> 16 -> 12...**
So **...15 -> 12 -> 16... -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
End **20**. Start **8**.
**20 -> 8**.
Cycle: **20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
We missed **1, 3, 7, 13**.
Insert them.
**4** is near **3**.
**12** is near **7**.
Path: **...19 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7 -> (jump to 11?)** No.
**...19 -> 4 -> 3 -> 13 -> (jump to 8?) -> 6...**
**13 -> 8** is good.
So: **19, 4, 3, 1, 7, 13, 8, 6, 18, 15, 12, 16**.
Wait, **3 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7** is messy.
**3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
**13** is the outlier.
**3 -> 13 -> 8**.
So path: **11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 19**.
**7 -> 4** is a cross.
**1 -> 4** is better.
**11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 4 -> 19...**
Then where do **1, 7, 12, 15, 18, 6** go?
**13 -> 15**?
**...13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> (jump to 12?) -> 7 -> 1 -> (jump to 3?)**
This is getting worse.

The path **16-12-7-1-3-13-15-18-6-8-20-14-11-4-19-5-10-9-17-2-16** is the most consistent "loop" shape.
It treats the cluster **6-18-15** as a detour from **13** returning to **8**.
Wait, **13** is higher than **15**. **6** is higher than **15**.
Order from top to bottom on right edge: **14, 20, 8, 13, 3** (inner), **6** (outer), **18, 15**.
Actually **6** is quite low.
Y-coordinates approx:
14: 18
20: 16
8: 12
13: 11
3: 9
6: 5
18: 3
15: 4
12: 5
7: 5
1: 7
So descending: **14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13**.
From **13**, go to **3**.
From **3**, go to **1 -> 7 -> 12**.
From **12**, go to **15**.
From **15 -> 18 -> 6**.
From **6**, go to **8**. (Backtrack up?)
Or from **6 -> 16**. (Long jump).

Let's try the descending order.
**...11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6**.
End at **6**. Start at **11**.
Left side: **19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16**.
Connect **16** to **6**. (Long).
Connect **19** to **11**. (Good).
This loop **16-6** is the penalty.

Compare **16-6** (~18 units) vs **13-15** (~6 units).
**13-15** penalty path:
**...20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16...**
Wait, **15 -> 13** requires passing **6** and **18**.
Path: **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15**. Then jump to **13**.
Then **13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16**.
This involves **15 -> 13** (~6 units) and **12 -> 16** (~8 units). Total 14.
The **16 -> 6** path involves **16 -> 6** (~18 units). Total 18.
The **13 -> 15** path is better.

So, the optimal path order is:
Start at **16**.
**16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2**.
Back to **16**.

Let's refine the **13 -> 15** transition.
Is **1 -> 7 -> 12** correct? Yes.
Is **3 -> 1** correct? Yes.
Is **13 -> 3** correct? Yes.
Is **15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8** correct?
**15** to **18** (close). **18** to **6** (close). **6** to **8** (med jump).
Alternative: **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15**. Then **15 -> 13**.
This seems smoother for the flow.
So reverse the right side?
**20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12**.
Then **12 -> 16**.
Then **16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
Let's check connections:
**15 -> 13**.
**12 -> 16**.
**19 -> 4**.
**14 -> 20**.
This looks solid.

Final check on the order of the list.
Start anywhere, e.g., 1.
1, 7, 12, 16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3.
Does **3** connect to **1**? Yes.
Let's double check **4 -> 11** vs **4 -> 19**.
In the sequence above: **19 -> 4 -> 11**.
**19** is (8, 16). **4** is (12, 12). **11** is (12, 15).
**19** and **11** are at similar Y. **4** is lower.
**19 -> 11** distance ~4.
**11 -> 4** distance ~3.
**4 -> 19** distance ~5.
So **19-11-4** is slightly better than **19-4-11**?
If **19 -> 11 -> 4**, then from **4**, where do we go? **3**?
**4** is very close to **3**.
**3** is close to **1** and **13**.
If **4 -> 3**, then **3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16...**
And **13**?
**4 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8 -> 20 -> 14 -> (back to 11?)**.
This creates a separate loop on the right.
We need to linearize.
**19 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 13 -> 3 -> 4**. (Loop **4 -> 19**).
Then attach bottom: **3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19**.
This looks very promising.
Edges:
**4 -> 19** (~5).
**3 -> 1** (~3).
**13 -> 15** (~6).
**6 -> 8** (~5).
**20 -> 14** (~4).
**11 -> 14** (~4).
**19 -> 5** (~3).
**16 -> 12** (~8).
This seems to minimize the sum of long edges.
Let's re-verify the **11 -> 14** link. **11** is closer to **4** than **14**.
But **11** is between **14** and **4/19**.
Sequence **19 -> 11 -> 14** is a bit zigzag. **14** is further right.
**19 -> 5** is left.
Top group: **10, 5, 19, 11, 14**.
Line: **10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 11 -> 14**.
Or **14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19**.
**14** is endpoint.
So **20 -> 14 -> 11 -> 4 -> 19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17 -> 2 -> 16 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> 8**.
Close **8 -> 20**.
This seems the most logical.

Let's trace this final path to be sure:
Start **20**.
**20 -> 14**. (Up).
**14 -> 11**. (Left-Down).
**11 -> 4**. (Down).
**4 -> 19**. (Left).
**19 -> 5**. (Left).
**5 -> 10**. (Up-Left).
**10 -> 9**. (Down-Left).
**9 -> 17**. (Down-Left).
**17 -> 2**. (Down-Right).
**2 -> 16**. (Down).
**16 -> 12**. (Right - The big jump).
**12 -> 7**. (Right).
**7 -> 1**. (Up-Left).
**1 -> 3**. (Up-Right).
**3 -> 13**. (Right).
**13 -> 15**. (Down-Right - The medium jump).
**15 -> 18**. (Down).
**18 -> 6**. (Up-Right).
**6 -> 8**. (Up-Left).
**8 -> 20**. (Up).
This covers all points. The logic holds up.

The list: 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7, 1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8.

Let's double check if starting at 1 makes for a nicer list in the prompt example style.
1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7.
Connections:
1-3: OK.
3-13: OK.
13-15: Jump.
15-18: OK.
18-6: OK.
6-8: Jump.
8-20: OK.
20-14: OK.
14-11: OK.
11-4: OK.
4-19: OK.
19-5: OK.
5-10: OK.
10-9: OK.
9-17: OK.
17-2: OK.
2-16: OK.
16-12: Jump.
12-7: OK.
7-1: OK.

Are there any better jumps?
What if **13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12**?
Path: **...3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7 -> 1...**
**1** connects to **3**. Loop closed prematurely.
We need to connect to the top.
Break at **8**? **...6 -> 8 -> 20...** (This is what I have).
Break at **4**? **...11 -> 4 -> 19...** (This is what I have).
Break at **12**? **...16 -> 12 -> 7...** (This is what I have).

Wait, **15** is closer to **12** than **13** is to **15**.
**12** (10,5). **15** (18,3). dist ~8.
**13** (17,9). **15** (18,3). dist ~6.
Actually **13-15** looks shorter or equal to **12-15**.
Visually, **13** is directly above **15** with a gap. **12** is far to the left.
I'll stick with **13-15**.

One variation: **4 -> 11**.
Is **4** closer to **11** or **19**?
**4** is equidistant.
Is **11** closer to **14** or **19**?
**11** is closer to **14**.
Is **19** closer to **5** or **11**?
**19** is closer to **5**.
So **5-19-4-11-14** is the logical line.
My path has **14-11-4-19-5**. Same line, reversed. Correct.

One variation: **16 -> 2**.
Is **16** closer to **2** or **12**?
**16** to **2** is closer.
So **2-16-12** is correct sequence direction? Or **12-16-2**?
If **12-16-2**, then **16** is a corner. Correct.

One variation: **6 -> 8**.
Is **6** closer to **8** or **18**? **18**.
Is **8** closer to **6** or **13** or **20**?
**8** is between **13, 6, 20**.
**8-20** is short. **8-13** is short. **8-6** is longer.
Since we must visit **6**, and **6** is an end of the **15-18-6** spur, connecting **6** to **8** is the only way out without crossing lines (e.g. 6-13 crosses 8-15).
So **6-8** is forced.

Final path confirmed:
1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7.

Let me just verify 15-18-6-8 vs 15-12.
If we do 15->12, we isolate 18, 6.
If we do 12->15->18->6, we end at 6.
Then 6->8.
This works.
What about 13->8->6->18->15->12?
13 to 8 (short).
8 to 6 (med).
6 to 18 (short).
18 to 15 (short).
15 to 12 (med).
12 to 7 (short).
This avoids the 13-15 jump.
The 13-15 jump is vertical. The 15-12 jump is horizontal.
Let's visually compare **13-15** vs **15-12**.
13 is approx x=17, y=10.
15 is approx x=18, y=4.
dy=6. dx=1. Dist=~6.1.
12 is approx x=10, y=5.
15 is approx x=18, y=4.
dx=8. dy=1. Dist=~8.
So **13-15** is shorter than **15-12**.
Also **6-8** (in my first path) vs **8-6** (in this path). Same length.
So the cost difference is **13-15** vs **15-12**.
Since **13-15** is shorter, the path I constructed first is better.

Path: **1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7**.

Wait, did I mess up the 1-7 connection in the first path?
My path was **7 -> 1 -> 3**.
List: 1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7.
End 7. Start 1.
7 and 1 are neighbors. Yes.
So the cycle is closed.

I will output starting from 1 for simplicity.

One last check on points 9, 10, 5, 19.
My path: **19 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 17**.
Is **19 -> 5** good? Yes.
Is **5 -> 10** good? Yes.
Is **10 -> 9** good? Yes.
Is **9 -> 17** good? Yes.
Is there an alternative? **19 -> 10 -> 9 -> 5 -> ...** No, 5 is lower.
**19 -> 10** is longer than **19 -> 5**.
**5 -> 9** crosses 10-17 line? No.
But **5-10-9-17** traces the top edge. It is optimal.

Final list:
1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7

Solution seems robust.

Re-read image numbers to ensure no typos.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
All present.

1 -> 3
3 -> 13
13 -> 15 (Jump)
15 -> 18
18 -> 6
6 -> 8 (Jump)
8 -> 20
20 -> 14
14 -> 11
11 -> 4
4 -> 19
19 -> 5
5 -> 10
10 -> 9
9 -> 17
17 -> 2
2 -> 16
16 -> 12 (Jump)
12 -> 7
7 -> 1

Looks good.

Alternative start for output to make it look "standard" (ascending start?):
1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7.

Double check 13-8 connection.
My path doesn't use 13-8 directly. It uses 13->15 and 6->8.
The distance 13-8 is very short.
Is breaking 13-8 worth it?
If I keep 13-8: **...3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 20...**
Then where do 6, 18, 15 go?
Branch off 8? **8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12**.
Then **12 -> 16**.
Then **16 -> 2 -> ... -> 19**.
Then **19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
This ends at 20. But we entered at 8 (from 13).
So **...13 -> 8 -> 6 -> 18 -> 15 -> 12 -> 16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 14 -> 20**.
Now close **20 -> 3**?? No.
Start was **1**. **1 -> 3**.
Close **20 -> 1**. No.
So we must break a short link to visit the spur.
Breaking **13-8** seems correct. The spur is **15-18-6**.
Entry **13-15**. Exit **6-8**.
This minimizes the detour cost.

Correct sequence established.

Format: Comma-separated list.
1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7

One final check on point 18 label.
It is below 6. Yes.
Point 15 label.
Left of 18. Yes.
Point 14 label.
Top right. Yes.
Point 4 label.
Under 11. Yes.
Point 1 label.
Above 12/7. Yes.
Point 2 label.
Above 16. Yes.

Everything consistent.

Wait, is **1** closer to **3** or **4**?
**1** (11, 7). **3** (14, 9). Dist ~3.6.
**1** (11, 7). **4** (12, 12). Dist ~5.
**1-3** is better.

Is **4** closer to **3** or **19**?
**4** (12, 12). **3** (14, 9). Dist ~3.6.
**4** (12, 12). **19** (8, 16). Dist ~5.6.
**4-3** is short.
My path uses **4 -> 19** and **1 -> 3**.
It does NOT use **4-3**.
The gap **3-4** is not traversed.
Instead we go **4 -> 11** and **3 -> 13**.
Let's check the bridge **4-3**.
If we use **4-3**:
**...19 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16 -> 2 -> 17 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 19...** (Loop A).
We missed **11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13**. (Loop B).
We need to merge Loop A and Loop B.
Closest points between loops: **4-11**, **3-13**, **12-15**?
My path merges at **13-15** and **6-8**.
Actually my path uses **13-15** and **6-8**. It separates **3-13** and **4-11**.
Wait, **13** is in the chain **1-3-13**.
**11** is in the chain **19-4-11**.
So **4** and **3** are separated.
Is it better to connect **4-3** and break **3-13**?
Path: **...11 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 16 -> 2...**
Where does **13** go? **13** must connect to **15** and **8**?
**...20 -> 8 -> 13 -> 15 -> 18 -> 6 -> (back to 20?)**
No, connect the right block to the main block.
**8** connects to **20**.
**6** connects to **16**? No.
So the layout **Left Block --(19-4)-- Top Block --(20-8)-- Right Block --(6-18-15-13-3-1-7-12-16)-- Left Block** is not quite right.
My path is **Left --(16-12)-- Bottom --(3-13-15)-- Spur --(6-8)-- Top --(11-4)-- Left**.
Bridges:
**16-12**: Long.
**13-15**: Med.
**6-8**: Med.
**11-4** or **4-19**: Short.
This seems structurally optimal. Minimizes the huge **6-16** jump.

Final answer formulated.

1, 3, 13, 15, 18, 6, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2, 16, 12, 7

I will start with 16 to follow the "sweep" logic.
16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3, 1, 7, 12
Wait, **16 -> 2** is good. **12 -> 16** is the closer.
Let's provide the answer starting with 1 as it is the smallest number.

1, 7, 12, 16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3

Check 3 -> 1. Yes.
Check 1 -> 7. Yes.
Check 7 -> 12. Yes.
Check 12 -> 16. Yes.
Check 16 -> 2. Yes.
Check 2 -> 17. Yes.
Check 17 -> 9. Yes.
Check 9 -> 10. Yes.
Check 10 -> 5. Yes.
Check 5 -> 19. Yes.
Check 19 -> 4. Yes.
Check 4 -> 11. Yes.
Check 11 -> 14. Yes.
Check 14 -> 20. Yes.
Check 20 -> 8. Yes.
Check 8 -> 6. Yes.
Check 6 -> 18. Yes.
Check 18 -> 15. Yes.
Check 15 -> 13. Yes.
Check 13 -> 3. Yes.

This is a valid tour.

One small detail: 19, 5, 10...
My previous trace was **19, 5, 10, 9, 17, 2**.
Is **19** closer to **5** or **4**? **5** is (6, 16). **19** is (8, 16). Dist 2.
**4** is (12, 12). **19** is (8, 16). Dist ~5.
So **19-5** is better than **19-4**.
However, **4** must connect to **19** to bridge the gap.
So **4 -> 19 -> 5** is correct.

Order:
1, 7, 12, 16, 2, 17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 4, 11, 14, 20, 8, 6, 18, 15, 13, 3
