To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I'll visually trace the path that connects the closest neighbors to form a complete loop without crossing lines. This is a heuristic approach, but for small sets of points like this, it typically yields the optimal or near-optimal solution.

Here is the step-by-step visual analysis:

1.  **Identify the points:** There are 10 points labeled 1 through 10.
2.  **Start at an edge:** Let's start at a clear "end" point to minimize choices. Point **5** is in the bottom left corner.
3.  **Find the nearest neighbor:** From 5, the closest point is clearly **3**.
4.  **Continue from 3:** The next closest logical step moving generally upwards is towards the cluster at the top left. The nearest point is **8**.
5.  **Navigate the top cluster:** From 8, point **9** is very close. From 9, the next one in the line is **7**.
6.  **Move across the top:** From 7, we continue moving right to point **2**.
7.  **Descend the right side:** From 2, the path naturally goes down to point **4**.
8.  **Continue down:** From 4, we go further down to point **10**.
9.  **Connect the bottom:** From 10, the path swings left to the bottom right corner, point **6**.
10. **Close the loop:** From 6, we move left to point **1**. Finally, from 1, the loop would close back to 5 (our starting point), completing the circuit.

**The sequence of visits is:**
5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 1

Let's double-check the reverse order to ensure it flows logically: 1 -> 6 -> 10 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7 -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> 5. This traces the perimeter of the shape formed by the points perfectly.

**Answer:**
5, 3, 8, 9, 7, 2, 4, 10, 6, 1
