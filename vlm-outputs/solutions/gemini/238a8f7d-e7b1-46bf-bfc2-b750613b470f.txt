To find the shortest tour, I need to visually inspect the points and connect them in a way that minimizes the total path length. This essentially means moving between nearest neighbors and avoiding paths that cross each other, creating a convex-hull-like shape with some indentations.

Here is the step-by-step visual analysis:

1.  **Identify Point Clusters:**
    *   There's a main cluster on the right side: 4, 8, 2, 7, 1.
    *   Points 5 and 9 form a pair lower down.
    *   Point 10 is isolated at the bottom left.
    *   Point 3 is somewhat central-left.
    *   Point 6 is isolated at the top left.

2.  **Constructing the Path:**
    *   Let's start at the top right cluster. **Point 4** and **Point 8** are very close. **Point 8** is close to **Point 2**.
    *   From **Point 2**, the next closest is **Point 7**.
    *   From **Point 7**, the path naturally goes down to the lower right pair. **Point 9** is the closest.
    *   From **Point 9**, move to its neighbor **Point 5**.
    *   From **Point 5**, the path needs to sweep back towards the left. The logical next stop is the bottom-leftmost point, **Point 10**.
    *   From **Point 10**, move upwards to the next point in the sequence, which is **Point 3**.
    *   From **Point 3**, continue moving up and left to the farthest point, **Point 6**.
    *   From **Point 6**, we need to return towards the starting area. The closest point to connect back into the central group is **Point 1**.
    *   From **Point 1**, we close the loop back to the top right cluster. **Point 1** connects well to **Point 8** or **Point 2**, but we've already visited them. Let's look at the connections again.

    *Let's re-evaluate the local connections to ensure no crossing lines:*
    *   **4 -> 7**: It's better to go 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7? Or 4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8? Visually, 4 is top-right, 8 is top-left of that group.
    *   Let's try a counter-clockwise loop starting from the top-leftmost point, **6**.
    *   **6 -> 3**: Clear path down.
    *   **3 -> 10**: Continue down to the bottom-left corner.
    *   **10 -> 5**: Long sweep across the bottom.
    *   **5 -> 9**: Short hop to the neighbor.
    *   **9 -> 7**: Move up the right side.
    *   **7 -> 2**: Move inward slightly.
    *   **2 -> 4**: Move to the top right corner. (Wait, 2 to 4 might skip 8. Let's look closer. 8 is higher than 2. 4 is higher than 7).
    *   Let's look at the top right cluster: 8, 2, 7, 4.
        *   7 is lowest.
        *   2 is middle-left.
        *   8 is top-left.
        *   4 is top-right.
        *   A good sub-tour here is 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8. Or 9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 (but 2 connects to 1). Let's see where 1 is. Point 1 is to the left of 2.
    *   So, coming from 6 -> 1 is a valid edge. Let's try that direction.
    *   **6 -> 1**: Move right.
    *   **1 -> 8**: Move up/right.
    *   **8 -> 4**: Move right.
    *   **4 -> 2**: Move down/left. But 2 is quite close to 7. 4->7 is an outer edge. 4->2 is an inner edge.
    *   Let's try keeping to the "convex hull" or outer perimeter as much as possible.
    *   Start at **6** (top left).
    *   Go to **1** (next closest to the right).
    *   From **1**, go to **8** (top part of the right cluster).
    *   From **8**, go to **4** (top right tip).
    *   From **4**, go down to **7** (skipping 2? No, 2 is inside). If I go 4 -> 7, how do I get 2?
        *   Maybe 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4? No, 1 is far from 2.
        *   Let's reconsider the cluster 1, 8, 2, 4, 7. The spatial arrangement is roughly: 1 is west. 8 is north-west. 4 is north-east. 7 is south-east. 2 is central.
        *   Actually, looking at the coordinates:
            *   1 is left of 8.
            *   8 is left of 4.
            *   2 is below 8 and left of 7.
            *   7 is below 4.
        *   Path: ... -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 2? No, 2 is "inside" the arc 1-8-4-7. Going to 2 from 7 means I have to leave 2. Where to? To 5? That's a long way.
        *   Let's try to grab 2 on the way up or down.
        *   Let's try coming from the bottom: ... -> 9 -> 7. From 7, closest unvisited is 2 or 4.
        *   If 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1, then from 1 go to 6? This looks smoother.
        *   Let's trace: **10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 10**.
            *   10 to 5: Good.
            *   5 to 9: Good.
            *   9 to 7: Good.
            *   7 to 4: Outer edge. Good.
            *   4 to 8: Top edge. Good.
            *   8 to 2: 2 is just below 8. Good.
            *   2 to 1: 1 is to the left of 2. Good.
            *   1 to 6: 6 is far left, but 1 is the bridge. Good.
            *   6 to 3: Downward. Good.
            *   3 to 10: Downward to start. Good.
    *   Let's check the segment 2 -> 1. Is 2 close to 1? Yes, relatively.
    *   Let's check the segment 8 -> 2. Yes, they are neighbors.
    *   Let's check 4 -> 8. Neighbors.
    *   Let's check 7 -> 4. Neighbors.
    *   Alternative in the top right: 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4? Then from 4 to... nowhere (dead end). So 4 must be connected to two points. Likely 7 and 8.
    *   So the sequence ... -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> ... is highly probable.
    *   After 8, we need to pick up 2 and 1. We need to exit towards 6.
    *   The exit to 6 comes best from 1. 1 is the leftmost of that right-hand group.
    *   So we must end the right-hand cluster visit at 1.
    *   To end at 1, we should come from 2. (8->2->1 or 4->?->1).
    *   8 is closer to 2 than 4 is to 2.
    *   So 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 seems like the optimal local path for those specific points.
    *   Let's verify the connection before that. We need to enter this cluster at 4.
    *   The previous point is 7.
    *   Is 9 -> 7 -> 4 efficient? Yes.
    *   So the chain is 9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1.
    *   Then 1 -> 6 is a long jump, but necessary.
    *   Then 6 -> 3.
    *   Then 3 -> 10.
    *   Then 10 -> 5.
    *   Then 5 -> 9 to close the loop.

    Let's double check if 2 could be inserted elsewhere.
    Could it be 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9?
    2 to 9 is a longer jump than 7 to 9. Also 7 is "shielding" 2 from 9. So 2 -> 9 would likely cross the path of something connecting to 7.
    Therefore, 7 needs to connect to 9.
    If 7 connects to 9 and 4, then 2 must be handled "internally" within the top cluster.
    The only neighbors of 2 are 1, 8, 7.
    If 7 connects to 4 and 9, 2 cannot connect to 7 (unless 7 is an endpoint, but it's a cycle).
    Wait, could it be 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1...?
    4 to 1 is a longer stretch and cuts across. 4 and 8 are top neighbors. It's better to keep them linked.
    Let's compare distances visually:
    Path A: 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 (My current favorite)
    Path B: 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 (4 to 1 is long)
    Path C: 7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 (4 is stuck, needs to go to 6? No, 4 to 6 is terrible).

    So, the sequence **7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1** looks solid for that cluster.

    Now connect the rest:
    From 1, go to **6**.
    From 6, go to **3**.
    From 3, go to **10**.
    From 10, go to **5**.
    From 5, go to **9**.
    From 9, go back to **7**.

    The full cycle is: **1, 6, 3, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 8, 2**.
    Let's check the link 2 -> 1. Yes, reasonable.
    Let's check the link 1 -> 6. Yes.
    Let's check 6 -> 3. Yes.
    Let's check 3 -> 10. Yes.
    Let's check 10 -> 5. Yes.
    Let's check 5 -> 9. Yes.
    Let's check 9 -> 7. Yes.
    Let's check 7 -> 4. Yes.
    Let's check 4 -> 8. Yes.
    Let's check 8 -> 2. Yes.

    Is there any other possibility?
    What about 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6 -> ... 1?
    From 6 to 1 is fine.
    From 1 to 8: Distance is X.
    From 2 to 1 (previous path): Distance is Y. X and Y are similar.
    However, if we do 1 -> 8, then 2 is stranded.
    How do we visit 2?
    Maybe 8 -> 2 -> 7?
    If 1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7, then where does 4 go? 4 is a corner. It must connect to 8 and 7.
    If 4 connects to 8 and 7, then 2 cannot be between 8 and 7.
    Can 2 be between 1 and 8? 1 -> 2 -> 8. This looks plausible.
    Let's trace: 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6.
    Compare the segment 1 -> 2 -> 8 vs 1 -> 8 -> ? (with 2 handled after 8).
    In the previous model (8->2->1), we had 4->8->2->1.
    In this new model, we have 1->2->8->4.
    Let's look at the triangle 1-2-8.
    1 is left. 8 is top. 2 is bottom-right of the triangle.
    Geometrically, going 1 -> 8 -> 2 crosses the line 1-2? No.
    Going 1 -> 2 -> 8 is a sharper turn. 2 is somewhat "inside" the pocket formed by 1, 8, 7.
    Actually, 2 sits between 1 and 7 more than 1 and 8.
    Looking closely at the image:
    Point 2 is located roughly at (x, y).
    Point 8 is at (x-small, y+small).
    Point 1 is at (x-large, y).
    Point 7 is at (x+small, y-small).
    Visually, 2 is closest to 8 and 7.
    So the sequence should probably involve ...-8-2-7-... or ...-7-2-8-...
    If we do 7-2-8, then 4 is isolated. 4 is very close to 8. 4 is further from 2.
    So 2 should probably not connect to 4.
    This reinforces the 4-8 link.
    If 4 connects to 8, and 2 connects to 8... that makes 8 a hub with 3 connections (4, 2, and the incoming one). That's impossible for a TSP tour. Each node has degree 2.
    So we cannot have links (4-8) AND (2-8).
    Wait, look at the distances again.
    Distance 8-4 is very short.
    Distance 8-2 is short.
    Distance 4-2 is longer than 8-2.
    So 4-8-2 looks like a "V" shape. This is a valid path segment.
    So ... -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> ...
    From 2, where do we go? We can go to 1 or 7.
    If we go 2 -> 7, then 4 must connect to something else on the other side. 4 -> 9? Too far.
    So 4 must connect to 7.
    If 4 connects to 7 (to close that side), then we have the segment 7-4-8-2.
    From 2, we must go to 1.
    From 1, we go to 6.
    This leads back to my first proposed solution: **6, 1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3**.
    Wait, let's re-verify the 1-2-8-4-7 area.
    Is 1 closer to 2 or 8?
    1 looks slightly closer to 8 than to 2. Let me look really closely at the crop.
    Crop 2 shows 1, 2, 8.
    1 is horizontally aligned with the gap between 8 and 2, maybe slightly closer to 8.
    But if I go 6 -> 1 -> 8, then I have to go 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 2 ... -> 9?
    2 to 9 is crossing the 7-5 line or just being inefficient. 7 is much better positioned to go to 9.
    So 7 -> 9 is a fixed edge in my mind.
    This means 7 must connect to something else in the top cluster.
    If 7 connects to 2, then we have 9-7-2. Then 2 must go to 8? (closest). Then 8 to 4. Then 4 to 1?
    4 to 1 is a long edge cutting across the whole cluster. Not good.
    So 9-7 connecting to 2 is unlikely.
    This means 9-7 connects to 4. (9->7->4).
    If 9-7-4, then 4 connects to 8 (closest).
    Then 8 connects to 2 (closest).
    Then 2 connects to 1 (closest remaining).
    Then 1 connects to 6 (closest remaining heading out).
    This confirms the path: **9-7-4-8-2-1-6**.

    Let's trace the rest again.
    6 -> 3. (Obvious).
    3 -> 10. (Obvious).
    10 -> 5. (Obvious, completing the convex hull).
    5 -> 9. (Obvious).

    So the full loop is:
    **1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1**

    Let's write down the sequence starting from 6 as requested by my internal logic to keep it simple, then format as requested.
    Sequence: 6, 3, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 8, 2, 1
    
    Let's double check intersections.
    Edge 1-6 vs Edge 8-2? No intersection.
    Edge 1-2 vs Edge ...? No.
    Edge 2-8 vs Edge 4-7? No. 2, 8, 4, 7 form a sort of C shape.
       .8  .4
         .2
           .7
    Path: 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2.
    7 to 4 is the right vertical.
    4 to 8 is the top horizontal.
    8 to 2 is a diagonal down-right.
    Does 8-2 cross 4-7? No. 2 is to the left of the line 4-7.
    Does 2-1 cross anything? 1 is to the left. No intersection.
    
    What about the sequence 6-3-10-5-9-7-2-8-4-1-6?
    This implies edges: 7-2, 2-8, 8-4, 4-1, 1-6.
    Edge 4-1 is very long. It spans past 8 and 2. It would likely intersect 8-2? No, 8 is above the line 4-1. 2 is below the line 4-1? Let's check. 4 is top right, 1 is mid-left. A line connecting them goes through the middle of the cluster. Point 8 is definitely above it. Point 2 is likely below it. So 4-1 is a "divider". But doing 4-1 skips neighbors like 8 and 2, which is inefficient.
    TSP heuristic: avoid long edges when short ones are available. 4-8 and 1-2 are much shorter than 4-1.
    Therefore, the path 1-2-8-4-7-... is geometrically superior to 1-4... or 1-?-?-4.
    
    Let's check 1-8-4-7-2-?
    Edges: 1-8 (ok), 8-4 (ok), 4-7 (ok).
    Now at 7. Connect to 2. Edge 7-2 (ok).
    Now at 2. Connect to 9?
    Edge 2-9 is long. Edge 7-9 is much shorter.
    So we shouldn't be ending the cluster at 2 if we want to go to 9. We should end at 7.
    Or, begin at 7 coming from 9.
    So ... -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> ...
    This is a strong constraint.
    Entering the cluster at 7.
    We need to leave the cluster at 1 (to go to 6).
    So we need a path from 7 to 1 inside the cluster covering {2, 4, 8}.
    Path options from 7 to 1:
    A) 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 (Bad: 4-1 is long).
    B) 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 (Good: all edges are short neighbors).
    C) 7 -> 2 -> 1? (Leaves 8, 4 stranded).
    D) 7 -> 4 -> 1? (Leaves 8, 2 stranded).

    Option B is the clear winner.
    Path segment: 9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6.

    Let's review the whole chain one more time.
    Start 6.
    6 -> 3
    3 -> 10
    10 -> 5
    5 -> 9
    9 -> 7
    7 -> 4
    4 -> 8
    8 -> 2
    2 -> 1
    1 -> 6
    
    Let's do a sanity check on 5, 9, 7.
    Is 5 -> 7 better than 5 -> 9?
    If 5 -> 7, then 9 is stranded. 9 is an "ear" or corner. It has to be connected to its two closest neighbors. Those are 5 and 7.
    So the sequence ...-5-9-7-... is mandatory.

    Let's do a sanity check on 6, 3, 10.
    6 is a corner. Neighbors 1, 3. Sequence ...-1-6-3-...
    10 is a corner. Neighbors 3, 5. Sequence ...-3-10-5-...
    
    This fixes the left and bottom parts: 1-6-3-10-5-9-7.
    Now we just need to route 7 back to 1 through {2, 4, 8}.
    We established 7->4->8->2->1 is the best route.

    Final check of the list.
    1, 6, 3, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 8, 2
    (Then 2 connects back to 1).

    The order can be reversed:
    1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    I will provide one of these lists. The prompt example starts with 1, so I'll start with 1.
    1, 6, 3, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 8, 2
    
    Wait, let's look at 2->1 vs 8->1.
    Visually 1 is quite far from 2.
    Is 1 closer to 8?
    Coordinate estimate:
    1: (400, 200)
    8: (500, 150)
    2: (520, 220)
    Distance 1-8 seems roughly sqrt(100^2 + 50^2) ~ 111.
    Distance 1-2 seems roughly sqrt(120^2 + 20^2) ~ 121.
    They are very close.
    Let's check the consequence of 1-8.
    If 6-1-8, then we are at 8.
    Neighbors of 8 are 4 and 2.
    If 8->4, then 4->7, then 7->2 (dead end? needs to go to 9).
    If 7->2, then 2->9 is bad (crossing).
    If 8->2, then 2->7, then 7->4? (dead end? needs to go to 9).
    It seems 7 must connect to 9.
    So 9-7 is an edge.
    If we arrive at the cluster via 1-8, we must leave via 7-9 (or vice versa).
    Path: 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> ... -> 7 -> 9.
    Middle part is path from 8 to 7 covering {2, 4}.
    Options:
    8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7? (4 to 2 is ok-ish, but longer than 4-8. 4-2 crosses nothing. 2-7 is neighbor).
    8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7? (2 to 4 is ok-ish. 4-7 is neighbor).
    Let's compare {8->4->2->7} vs {8->2->4->7} vs previous {1->2->8->4->7}.
    
    Previous model: 1 connected to 2.
    New thought: 1 connects to 8.
    
    Let's check the 1-2 vs 1-8 connection again.
    Look at the gap between 1 and the cluster.
    8 is high. 2 is low. 1 is vertically between them?
    1 looks higher than 2. 1 looks lower than 8.
    So 1 is roughly in the middle.
    
    Let's look at the 2-4 crossing issue.
    If path is 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7.
    Distance 8-4 is very small.
    Distance 2-7 is very small.
    Distance 4-2 is medium.
    Total length = Short + Medium + Short.
    
    If path is 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7.
    Distance 8-2 is short-ish.
    Distance 2-4 is medium.
    Distance 4-7 is Short-ish.
    Comparing (8-4 + 2-7) vs (8-2 + 4-7).
    8-4 is the shortest edge in that top cluster alongside 4-7? No 4-7 is longer. 8-4 is very close.
    2-7 is very close.
    8-2 is close.
    4-7 is close.
    The diagonal 4-2 is definitely longer than the edges 8-2 or 4-7.
    So avoiding the diagonal 4-2 is preferred.
    This eliminates 8->4->2->7 and 7->4->2->8.
    
    So we shouldn't use edge 4-2.
    We should use edges around the perimeter: 8-4, 4-7, 7-2... wait.
    Perimeter is 8-4-7-2-?
    Is 2 adjacent to 8? Yes.
    Is 2 adjacent to 7? Yes.
    Is 2 adjacent to 1? Yes.
    So 2 is connected to 8, 7, 1.
    We need to pick 2 edges for point 2.
    Options: (8,7), (8,1), (7,1).
    
    Case A: Edges (2-8) and (2-7).
       Path segment: ... -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...
       The 4 is connected to 8 and 7 to close the sub-loop?
       Path: ... -> 1 -> ? ... -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 9.
       If 2 is used, where does 4 go?
       4 must connect to 8 and 7 (its only real neighbors).
       If 4 connects to 8 and 7, then we have edges 8-4 and 4-7.
       We also have edges for 2: 2-8 and 2-7?
       If we have 8-4, 4-7, 7-2, 2-8... that's a closed loop 8-4-7-2-8 isolated from 1 and 9.
       We can't have a sub-cycle.
       So we must break this ring.
       We need to enter at one point and leave at another.
       Entrance from 1. Exit to 9 (via 7).
       So we enter at 8 or 2? Or 4?
       1 is closest to 2 and 8.
       Exit is at 7 (closest to 9).
       So path is (1) -> [Start] -> ... -> 7 -> (9).
       [Start] must be 2 or 8.
       
       Scenario 1: Enter at 2. (1-2).
       Path: 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 7.
       Remaining points: 8, 4.
       We need to go 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7.
       Check edges: 1-2 (ok), 2-8 (ok), 8-4 (ok), 4-7 (ok), 7-9 (ok).
       This looks perfect. No crossing. Follows "convex hull".
       
       Scenario 2: Enter at 8. (1-8).
       Path: 1 -> 8 -> ... -> 7.
       Remaining points: 2, 4.
       Route 1: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7. (Bad: 4-2 is a diagonal cross/long).
       Route 2: 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7. (Bad: 2-4 is a diagonal cross/long).
       
       Conclusion: Scenario 1 is the correct one.
       The path enters the cluster at 2 and leaves at 7 (or vice versa).
       The sequence is 1-2-8-4-7-9. (Or reverse).

    So, the final path is confirmed:
    ... -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6 ...

    Let's write out the list starting from 1.
    1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    Let's double check the user's example format.
    "1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6"
    Just integers, comma separated.

    One final visual check of 1-2 vs 1-8.
    If I draw a line from 6 to 1, and extend it, it hits 2?
    6 is high left. 1 is middle. 2 is middle right.
    Line 6-1-2 is roughly straight.
    Line 1-8 goes up.
    Line 1-2 goes straight/down.
    Going 6->1->8 creates a zig-zag (down to 1, up to 8).
    Going 6->1->2 is smoother.
    This supports the 1-2 connection.

    Also check 2-1-6.
    Angle at 1.
    2 is at ~3 o'clock from 1.
    6 is at ~10 o'clock from 1.
    Angle is obtuse. Good.
    If 8-1-6:
    8 is at ~1 o'clock.
    6 is at ~10 o'clock.
    Angle is acute. Sharper turn.
    Generally, TSPs prefer obtuse angles (smoother paths).

    So 1-2 is definitely better than 1-8.

    Final sequence:
    1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> 3 -> 6 -> (back to 1)

    Output string:
    1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    Wait, I should check the reverse direction to see if I missed anything.
    6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1
    This is the same.

    Are there any labels I misread?
    Top left: 6
    Mid left: 3 (label below dot)
    Bottom left: 10
    Bottom mid: 5
    Bottom right: 9
    Right cluster bottom: 7
    Right cluster top right: 4
    Right cluster top left: 8
    Right cluster mid: 2
    Right cluster left: 1

    All labels seem correct.

    Final check on 10, 5, 9.
    10 is clearly bottom left.
    5 is bottom middle.
    9 is bottom right.
    This creates a clean bottom edge.
    Connection to 3 from 10 is the only way up on the left.
    Connection to 7 from 9 is the only way up on the right.
    So the "cup" shape 3-10-5-9-7 is very robust.
    The "lid" is 6-1-2-8-4.
    Wait, 7 connects to 4.
    So the loop is 3-10-5-9-7-4-8-2-1-6-3.
    Edges:
    3-10
    10-5
    5-9
    9-7
    7-4
    4-8
    8-2
    2-1
    1-6
    6-3

    Let's re-verify 7-4 vs 7-2.
    Geometrically, 7 is below 2 and 4.
    9 is below 7.
    Path comes up from 9 to 7.
    From 7, we continue "up".
    4 is the "highest" point on the far right.
    8 is the "highest" point on the mid right.
    If we go 7 -> 2, we go "in". Then to get to 4 and 8, we have to go 2->8->4... then 4 is a dead end. Or 2->4->8... then 8 must go to 1.
    If 8 goes to 1, we have 1-8-4-2-7-9.
    Edge 1-8 (ok). Edge 8-4 (ok). Edge 4-2 (diagonal/long). Edge 2-7 (ok).
    Comparing my two main candidates:
    Candidate 1: 1-2-8-4-7-9 (Edges: 1-2, 2-8, 8-4, 4-7, 7-9)
    Candidate 2: 1-8-4-2-7-9 (Edges: 1-8, 8-4, 4-2, 2-7, 7-9)
    
    Difference is {1-2, 2-8, 4-7} vs {1-8, 4-2, 2-7}.
    Visually:
    1-2 vs 1-8: Similar. 1-2 maybe slightly longer?
    2-8 vs 4-2: 2-8 is a neighbor. 4-2 is a diagonal jumping over 8? Or at least "inside". 4-2 is definitely longer than 2-8.
    4-7 vs 2-7: 4-7 is vertical side. 2-7 is diagonal inside. 4-7 is longer than 2-7.
    
    Let's look at the shape 8-4-7-2.
    It's a generic quadrilateral.
     Vertices in counter-clockwise order: 8, 2, 7, 4. (Wait, 2 is left of 7? 7 is rightmost below 4).
    Let's assume coordinates.
    8: (0, 10)
    4: (10, 12)
    7: (8, 0)
    2: (2, 4)
    Perimeter 8-4-7-2-8 would be 8->2->7->4->8.
    If we can't close the loop, we path through.
    Path 1 (via 4-7): ...-8-4-7-2-... (Need to connect 2 to start/end).
    Path 2 (via 4-2): ...-8-4-2-7-... (Need to connect 7 to start/end).
    
    In my full path:
    1-2-8-4-7-9.
    Vertices involved: 1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9.
    Edges: 1-2, 2-8, 8-4, 4-7, 7-9.
    This traverses the "C" shape of the cluster 1-2-8-4-7 by following the outer boundary (mostly). 1-2 cuts in a bit, but connects to the start of the chain.
    Is 2-8-4-7 the sequence? Yes.
    It seems the most natural flow.

    What if 1 connects to 2, and 8 connects to 1?
    Loop: 1-2-7-4-8-1?
    Edges: 1-2, 2-7, 7-4, 4-8, 8-1.
    Then 1-6. But 8-1-6 is a sharp acute angle.
    And 7 connects to 9.
    So this would be ...9-7-2-1-8-4... (dead end at 4).
    Or ...9-7-4-8-1-2... (dead end at 2).
    This confirms the linear chain through the cluster is necessary.
    The chain ends must be 1 and 7.
    The internal nodes are 2, 4, 8.
    We need a path from 1 to 7 using {2, 4, 8}.
    Possible permutations of {2, 4, 8}:
    1) 2-8-4 -> Path: 1-2-8-4-7. Cost: d(1,2)+d(2,8)+d(8,4)+d(4,7).
    2) 2-4-8 -> Path: 1-2-4-8-7. Cost: d(1,2)+d(2,4)+d(4,8)+d(8,7). (8-7 is diagonal long? No, 8 and 7 are far. 2 and 4 are far). Bad.
    3) 8-2-4 -> Path: 1-8-2-4-7. Cost: d(1,8)+d(8,2)+d(2,4)+d(4,7). (2-4 is bad).
    4) 8-4-2 -> Path: 1-8-4-2-7. Cost: d(1,8)+d(8,4)+d(4,2)+d(2,7). (4-2 is bad).
    5) 4-8-2 -> Path: 1-4-8-2-7. Cost: d(1,4)+d(4,8)+d(8,2)+d(2,7). (1-4 is terrible).
    6) 4-2-8 -> Path: 1-4-2-8-7. (1-4 is terrible).
    
    Winner is clearly permutation 1: 2-8-4.
    This yields the segment 1-2-8-4-7.
    
    This confirms my previous derivation.
    Full list: 1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6.

    Wait, did I mess up 7 connecting to 9?
    Path: ... 4-7-9 ...
    Yes, 4-7 is the last step of the internal chain, connecting to the external node 9.
    
    Is it possible that 2 connects to 9?
    Path: ...-8-4-7-2-9-5...
    Edges: 7-2 (short), 2-9 (long, crosses 7-5 line potentially).
    7 is spatially between 2 and 9.
    So 7 must be visited between 2 and 9.
    Or 7 is visited before 2, and 2 goes to 9?
    If 7 is between 2 and 9, then 2->7->9 is the path.
    This matches my sequence direction (reversed): 9-7-4-8-2-1.
    Wait, if the sequence is 9-7-2-8-4-1.
    This uses permutation {2, 8, 4} but in a different topological order?
    Let's trace 9-7-2-8-4-1.
    Edges: 9-7, 7-2, 2-8, 8-4, 4-1.
    4-1 is the long "diagonal" edge. We rejected this earlier.
    My previous winner was 1-2-8-4-7-9.
    Reversed: 9-7-4-8-2-1.
    Edges: 9-7, 7-4, 4-8, 8-2, 2-1.
    This avoids the long 4-1 edge.
    This is definitely the optimal path.

    Final sequence is 1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6.

    Let me check starting points. The user said "List each point label once, in visit order. Do NOT repeat the first point at the end."
    I can start anywhere. Starting at 1 is standard.
    
    Sequence: 1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    Double check point 3 label.
    Yes, it is 3.
    Double check point 10 label.
    Yes, 10.
    Double check point 5 label.
    Yes, 5.
    Double check point 9 label.
    Yes, 9.
    Double check point 7 label.
    Yes, 7.
    Double check point 4 label.
    Yes, 4.
    Double check point 8 label.
    Yes, 8.
    Double check point 2 label.
    Yes, 2.
    Double check point 1 label.
    Yes, 1.
    Double check point 6 label.
    Yes, 6.

    One oddity: Point 7 label is to the right. Point 9 label is to the right.
    Point 2 label is left.
    Point 8 label is left.
    Point 4 label is right.
    Point 1 label is left.
    Point 6 label is left.
    Point 3 label is below.
    Point 10 label is below.
    Point 5 label is left.
    
    Everything looks fine.

    Is there any ambiguity about 10 -> 3 vs 10 -> 6?
    10 is (100, 500).
    3 is (200, 250).
    6 is (100, 50).
    10->6 is distance ~450.
    10->3 is distance ~270.
    3 is much closer.
    Also 10-6 would cut off 3. 3 would be stranded inside the hull.
    So 10-3 is mandatory.
    
    Is there ambiguity about 6 -> 3 vs 6 -> 1?
    6 is (100, 50).
    3 is (200, 250).
    1 is (400, 200).
    6->3 is ~250.
    6->1 is ~330.
    However, 3 needs to connect to something. 3 connects to 10.
    So we have chain ...-10-3-...
    3 needs another neighbor.
    Distance 3-6 ~250.
    Distance 3-1 ~200.
    Distance 3-5 ~300.
    So 3 should connect to 6 and 1?
    If 3 connects to 6 and 1.
    Path: ...10-?-3-1-6... or ...10-?-3-6-1...
    If 3 connects to 1, then 6 is a dead end (corner) or must connect to 1.
    If 6 connects to 1 and 3.
    Then we have triangle 1-3-6.
    Path ...-10-3-6-1-2-...
    This is a valid alternative.
    Let's compare:
    Route A: 1-6-3-10
    Route B: 2-1-3-6 (6 dead end?) No, 6 must connect to something else. No other points nearby.
    So 6 must connect to its two closest neighbors.
    Closest to 6 are 3 and 1.
    So 6 MUST be in the sequence ...-3-6-1-...
    Wait, my previous path was ...-3-6-1-... (reversed 1-6-3).
    Let's check distance 6-3 vs 6-8 or something.
    3 is definitely closest.
    1 is second closest.
    So 6 is indeed connected to 3 and 1.
    This validates the 1-6-3 segment.
    
    Then from 3, closest is 10. (Sequence 6-3-10).
    From 10, closest is 5. (Sequence 3-10-5).
    From 5, closest is 9. (Sequence 10-5-9).
    From 9, closest is 7. (Sequence 5-9-7).
    From 7, closest is 4 (since 2 is "behind" 7). (Sequence 9-7-4).
    From 4, closest is 8. (Sequence 7-4-8).
    From 8, closest is 2. (Sequence 4-8-2).
    From 2, closest is 1. (Sequence 8-2-1).
    From 1, closest is 6. (Loop closed).
    
    This seems incredibly stable.

    Final Answer construction.
    1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    Is there any reason to start at a different node? No, usually start at 1.
    Is there any reason to reverse? No, but I'll check "1, 6, 3..." vs "1, 2, 8...".
    Usually clockwise or counter-clockwise doesn't matter.
    The order "1, 2, 8..." feels "counter-clockwise" if 1 is 9 o'clock.
    Let's assume standard reading order.
    1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    Correctness Check:
    Visits all nodes? Yes (1..10).
    No repeats? Yes.
    Cycle? Yes.
    Shortest? Based on Nearest Neighbor and convex hull heuristics, yes.

    Final check of the comma separated format.
    "1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6"

    Just in case, let me re-evaluate the 2-1 connection.
    Is it possible that the cluster is 1-2-7-4-8-1?
    Edges: 1-2, 2-7, 7-4, 4-8, 8-1.
    This is a local loop.
    We need to break it to connect to 6 and 9.
    Connection to 6 is best at 1.
    Connection to 9 is best at 7.
    So we remove edge 1-7? No edge 1-7 existed.
    We have path 6-1-...-7-9.
    Internal path from 1 to 7.
    Using nodes 2, 8, 4.
    If we follow the ring 1-2-7-4-8-1, the path from 1 to 7 is just 1-2-7.
    This leaves 4 and 8.
    If we go 1-2-7, we skip 4 and 8.
    So we must go the long way around the ring.
    Path: 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7.
    What about 2?
    2 is skipped.
    So the ring logic 1-8-4-7 doesn't work because 2 is off the path.
    We need to include 2.
    2 is attached to 1, 8, 7.
    If we go 1-8-4-7, 2 is "inside".
    We must grab 2.
    1-8-2-4-7? (4-2 diagonal).
    1-2-8-4-7? (Standard chain).
    This confirms 1-2-8-4-7 is the only non-crossing, nearest-neighbor way to sweep that cluster from 1 to 7.

    Final list: 1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6

    Wait, I might have the relative positions of 2 and 8 swapped in my mental model?
    Let's look at image.
    8 is top-left of cluster.
    2 is below 8.
    4 is top-right.
    7 is below 4.
    1 is left of 8/2.
    My previous analysis:
    1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7.
    1 to 2 (down-right).
    2 to 8 (up-left).
    8 to 4 (right).
    4 to 7 (down).
    Does 2-8 cross 1-? No.
    Does 2-8 cross anything?
    1 is at (Left), 2 is at (Mid-Low), 8 is at (Mid-High).
    Path 1 -> 2 -> 8 forms a "V" shape pointing right.
    Then 8 -> 4 (Right).
    This looks like a zig-zag.
    Alternative: 1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 ...? (Leaving 4 stranded).
    Alternative: 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 ...? (Leaving 2 stranded).
    
    Let's reconsider 1 -> 8 -> 2 ...
    If 1 goes to 8. Then 8 goes to 2? (Down).
    Then 2 goes to 4? (Up-Right).
    Then 4 goes to 7? (Down).
    Path: 1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7.
    Edges: 1-8, 8-2, 2-4, 4-7.
    1-8 (ok).
    8-2 (ok).
    2-4 (Diagonal. Crosses nothing but is longer than 2-7 or 8-4).
    4-7 (ok).
    
    Compare 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7.
    Edges: 1-2, 2-8, 8-4, 4-7.
    1-2 (ok).
    2-8 (ok).
    8-4 (Short neighbor).
    4-7 (ok).
    
    The edge 8-4 is much shorter than 2-4.
    Therefore, keeping 8 and 4 connected is better.
    This breaks the 8-2-4 chain idea.
    
    So 1-2-8-4-7 is indeed better.

    One last alternative: 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> ?
    Path ends at 8. 8 must connect to 1 or 6?
    But we started at 1. So 8 connects to 6?
    If 8 connects to 6.
    Path: 6 -> 8 -> 4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3?
    Edges: 6-8 (Long diagonal). 8-4 (ok). 4-7 (ok). 7-2 (ok). 2-1 (ok). 1-3 (Longer than 1-6).
    6-8 is much longer than 6-1.
    1-3 is longer than 1-6.
    So this orientation is shifted and inefficient.
    1 should connect to 6.
    
    So the ends of the right cluster path are 1 and 7.
    This remains the constraint.
    And 1-2-8-4-7 is the path.

    Final check complete. answer is ready.

    1, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 10, 3, 6
