To find the shortest tour, I will visually analyze the spatial distribution of the points and construct a path that minimizes the total distance by connecting nearest neighbors and avoiding crossing lines.

Here is the step-by-step logic for the path:

1.  **Start at the bottom left:** Let's begin at point **10**.
2.  **Move right:** The nearest neighbor to the right is point **3**.
3.  **Continue right/up:** From 3, the logical next step is up to **13**.
4.  **Move right:** From 13, move right to point **11**.
5.  **Move down/right:** From 11, go down to point **14**.
6.  **Move up:** From 14, move up to point **1**.
7.  **Move up:** From 1, continue up to point **8**.
8.  **Move left/up:** From 8, move towards the center to point **12**.
9.  **Move up/right:** From 12, go up to point **5**.
10. **Move up/right:** From 5, go to the top right point, **9**.
11. **Move left:** From 9, go all the way left to point **6**.
12. **Move down:** From 6, go down to point **2**.
13. **Move left/down:** From 2, go down and left to point **7**.
14. **Move left:** From 7, go left to point **15**.
15. **Move down:** From 15, go down to point **4**.
16. **Close the loop:** From 4, the path naturally returns to the starting point **10**.

This creates a clean loop without any crossing paths, which is the hallmark of an optimal or near-optimal TSP solution in 2D Euclidean space.

**Tour:**
10, 3, 13, 11, 14, 1, 8, 12, 5, 9, 6, 2, 7, 15, 4
