Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, the most efficient path is a simple loop that connects nearest neighbors without crossing over itself.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Starting on the far left with **12**, move up to **4**.
2.  From **4**, go up to **18**, then over to **17**.
3.  Continue slightly down to **11**, then up to **2**.
4.  From **2**, go up to **7**, then east to **14** and **20**.
5.  Cross the gap to the upper right cluster, hitting **8**, then **9**, **6**, **10**, and **16**.
6.  Move down to the middle-right area to **15**, then **3**.
7.  Move west to **1**, then further west to **19**.
8.  Drop down to the bottom pair, hitting **13**, then **5**.
9.  From **5**, the loop naturally closes back to the starting region (towards 12), but the list ends here as requested.

Here is the ordered sequence:

**12, 4, 18, 17, 11, 2, 7, 14, 20, 8, 9, 6, 10, 16, 15, 3, 1, 19, 13, 5**
