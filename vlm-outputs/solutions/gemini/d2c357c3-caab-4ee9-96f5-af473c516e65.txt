To find the shortest tour, I will trace a path that connects nearest neighbors to form a logical loop, minimizing the total distance traveled.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Starting in the top-left area, let's begin at point **11**.
2.  Move right to the next closest point, **7**.
3.  Go up and slightly right to the isolated point at the top, **13**.
4.  Come back down to the central upper cluster, hitting **19**.
5.  Move right to **2**.
6.  Continue right to **18**.
7.  Further right to **14**.
8.  Go up to the top-right corner point, **4**.
9.  Come down along the right side to **3**.
10. Move inwards towards the center to **5**.
11. From the center, head left to **15**.
12. Continue left to **10**.
13. Drop down to the left-side point **6**.
14. Go down to the bottom-left corner to **1**.
15. Move right along the bottom to **9**.
16. Continue right to **20**.
17. Move up slightly to **12**.
18. Go right to the nearby point **16**.
19. Drop down to the bottom edge point **17**.
20. Finally, go to the far bottom-right point **8**.
21. (From 8, the loop would naturally close by going back towards the left or up the right side, but the prompt asks for the list without repeating the start).

**Final Path:**
11, 7, 13, 19, 2, 18, 14, 4, 3, 5, 15, 10, 6, 1, 9, 20, 12, 16, 17, 8
