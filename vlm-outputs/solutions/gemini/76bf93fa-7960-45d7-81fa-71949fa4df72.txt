Based on a visual analysis of the points to find the shortest path that connects them all in a single loop (a Traveling Salesman Problem tour), here is the optimal sequence.

I will start with point 4 on the far left and trace the path logically to minimize the total distance.

1.  **4** (Start top-left)
2.  **8** (Move down slightly)
3.  **12** (Move down to the bottom-left corner)
4.  **14** (Move right)
5.  **15** (Move up and slightly left)
6.  **11** (Move right to the center cluster)
7.  **1** (Move right)
8.  **2** (Move down and right)
9.  **3** (Move further down and right to the bottom-right corner)
10. **13** (Move up to the top-right corner)
11. **10** (Move left)
12. **6** (Move down and left)
13. **9** (Move left and up)
14. **5** (Move left)
15. **7** (Move down and slightly right)
(And from 7, the path returns to 4/8 to close the loop).

So, the tour sequence is:

**4, 8, 12, 14, 15, 11, 1, 2, 3, 13, 10, 6, 9, 5, 7**
