To find the shortest tour, I will trace the path by connecting nearest neighbors in a logical loop, avoiding crossing lines where possible.

Here is the step-by-step route construction:

1.  **Start at point 9** on the far left.
2.  Move to the next closest point downwards: **24**.
3.  From 24, move right to **1**.
4.  From 1, the nearest point is **18**.
5.  From 18, go down to **25**.
6.  From 25, move right to **22**.
7.  From 22, the logical next step is down to **11**.
8.  From 11, move right to **14**.
9.  From 14, go down to the corner point **13**.
10. From 13, move up to **7**.
11. From 7, go up to **23**.
12. From 23, move left to **3**.
13. From 3, continue left to **16**.
14. From 16, move left/down slightly to **4**.
15. From 4, move left/up to **10**.
16. From 10, go right to **21**.
17. From 21, go up to **19**.
18. From 19, move left/up to the isolated point **12**.
19. From 12, move left to **20**.
20. From 20, go up slightly to **5**.
21. From 5, go left to **8**.
22. From 8, go down/left to **17**.
23. From 17, go down to **15**.
24. From 15, go down/left to **6**.
25. From 6, go down to **2**.
26. Finally, from 2, you would return to **9** to complete the loop.

**Tour Order:**
9, 24, 1, 18, 25, 22, 11, 14, 13, 7, 23, 3, 16, 4, 10, 21, 19, 12, 20, 5, 8, 17, 15, 6, 2
