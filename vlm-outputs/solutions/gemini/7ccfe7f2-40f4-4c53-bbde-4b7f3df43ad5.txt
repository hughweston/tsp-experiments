Based on visual inspection to minimize the total path length (Euclidean distance), the optimal or near-optimal tour follows the natural outer perimeter of the points, dipping inwards where necessary.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Start at the bottom right corner with point **2**.
2.  Move left to **10**, then further left to **7**.
3.  Go up and left to the cluster **9**, then **6**.
4.  Move inwards slightly to **3**.
5.  Go up to **15**.
6.  Move up and right to **12**.
7.  Continue right to the central cluster, hitting **5**, then **11**, then **4**.
8.  Move right to **14**.
9.  Go to the furthest top-right point **8**.
10. Drop down towards the center to **13**.
11. Move left to **1**.
12. From 1, the path would close back to 2 (completing the loop via the long segment from 1 to 2, or perhaps via 10, but looking at the layout, 1 sits somewhat centrally).

Let's refine the path to avoid crossing lines and keep neighbors close. A "convex hull" approach usually works best, dealing with interior points as needed.

*   Start at top-right **8**.
*   Go left to **14**.
*   Go left to **4**.
*   Go slightly down to **11**.
*   Go left to **5**.
*   Go left/up to **12**.
*   Go down to **15**.
*   Go down to **6**. (Or 15 -> 3 -> 6, but 15 -> 6 seems a bit of a stretch. Let's look closer. 15 is high up. 3 is below it. 6 and 9 are to the left.) Let's try: **15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7**.
*   From **7**, go right to **10**.
*   From **10**, go right to **2**.
*   From **2**, go up/left to **13**.
*   From **13**, go left to **1**.
*   From **1**, go up to connect back to the start region (near 4/11/5).

Wait, the connection **1 -> 5** is very close. The connection **1 -> 13** is reasonable.
Let's trace a loop:
8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13 -> 1 -> (back to start/near 5 or 4? No, 1 is close to 5 and 11).

Let's re-evaluate the center cluster (1, 5, 11, 4).
1 is below 5.
13 is to the right of 1.
8 and 14 are far top right.

Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep:
**2** -> **10** -> **7** -> **9** -> **6** -> **3** -> **15** -> **12** -> **5** -> **11** -> **4** -> **14** -> **8** -> **13** -> **1**.
And then from **1**, the return to **2** is quite long.

Is there a better insertion for 1 and 13?
13 is between 10/2 and 14/8.
1 is centrally located.

Let's try this sequence:
**2** -> **10** -> **7** -> **9** -> **6** -> **3** -> **15** -> **12** -> **5** -> **1** -> **11** -> **4** -> **14** -> **8** -> **13** -> (return to 2). This creates a very long edge from 13 to 2.

Let's try putting 13 and 1 in the middle of the sweep.
**2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10** (back to 2).
This looks much better.
Let's check the position of 1. Point 1 is right below 5 and above 13.
The segment **5 -> 11** is tight.
Where does 1 fit?
Maybe: ...**12 -> 5 -> 11 -> 4**... leaving 1 isolated? No.
Maybe: ...**12 -> 5 -> 1 -> 11**... No, 1 is below 5. 11 is to the right of 5.
Maybe: **12 -> 5 -> 1 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11**... that gets messy crossing back.

Let's look at the cluster **5, 11, 4, 1**.
They are roughly vertical. 4 (top), 11, 5, 1 (bottom).
It makes sense to visit them in sequence.
**4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 1**.

Let's try this tour:
Start at **6**.
**6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 1**.
From 1, can we close back to 6?
1 is near the center. 6 is far left. 3 is between them.
So **1 -> 3 -> 6** works well.

Let's trace that fully:
**6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 1 -> 3** ... (Back to 6).
Wait, **15 -> 1** is a bit of a jump. **15 -> 3** is closer.
Then **3 -> 1**. Then **1 -> 5** is close.

Let's try connecting the center cluster to the left side:
**15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14 -> 8 -> 13 -> 2 -> 10 -> 7 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1**.
From **1**, return to **15**. This is a reasonable long edge, but 1 is somewhat close to 15.

Let's refine the "1" insertion.
Is **3 -> 1 -> 5** better?
3 is left-center. 1 is center. 5 is center-top.
If we go **6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15**.
From 15, we need to get back to 6, picking up 1 and 3.
**15 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6**? 1 is quite far from 15.
**15 -> 3 -> 1**? Then 1 to where? Back to the start? If start was a loop.
If we connect **1 -> 5**, we break the previous chain.
Let's break the **5-12** link.
...**12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 5**.
And **5 -> 12** closes the loop.

Let's check the distances visually:
**11 -> 1**: Moderate distance.
**1 -> 5**: Very short distance.
**5 -> 12**: Moderate distance.
**12 -> 15**: Moderate distance.
**15 -> 3**: Moderate distance.
**3 -> 6**: Moderate distance.
**6 -> 9**: Short distance.
**9 -> 7**: Moderate distance.
**7 -> 10**: Long distance.
**10 -> 2**: Moderate distance.
**2 -> 13**: Moderate distance.
**13 -> 8**: Long distance.
**8 -> 14**: Short/Moderate.
**14 -> 4**: Moderate.
**4 -> 11**: Short.

Is there a better link than 7 -> 10?
Maybe **7 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 13 -> 2 -> 10**?
Then **10 -> 7** is a loop. No.
How about **10 -> 13**? No, 2 is in the corner. It must be **10 -> 2 -> 13**.
So the sequence **10, 2, 13** is almost certainly fixed.
The sequence **13, 8, 14, 4** is almost certainly fixed (moving up the right side).
The sequence **4, 11, 5, 12, 15** moves across the top.
Where does 1 go? 1 is very close to 5 and 11.
Instead of **4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12**, maybe **4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12**?
1 is below 5. 11 is right of 5.
The triangle 1-5-11 is tight.
**4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12** looks very efficient.
From **12**, go to **15**.
From **15**, go to **3**.
From **3**, go to **6**.
From **6**, go to **9**.
From **9**, go to **7**.
From **7**, go to **10**.
From **10**, go to **2**.
From **2**, go to **13**.
From **13**, go to **8**.
From **8**, go to **14**.
From **14**, go to **4**. (Closes the loop).

Let's double check the **13 -> 8** link versus others.
Could it be **13 -> 1 -> 5**?
If we do **2 -> 13 -> 1**, then we have to go to the right side **8, 14, 4** later or earlier.
If we go **13 -> 1**, **8** becomes isolated.
8 is top right. 13 is lower right.
The only way to visit 8 efficiently is **13 -> 8 -> 14** or **14 -> 8 -> 13**.
So the chain **2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4** seems robust.

Now check the 1 insertion again.
We have the chain coming from top right: **... -> 14 -> 4 -> 11**.
We need to go left towards 12.
Points in the middle are 5 and 1.
1 is below 5.
If we go **11 -> 5 -> 12**, we skip 1.
If we go **11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12**:
11 to 1 is a bit down-left.
1 to 5 is up-left.
5 to 12 is left.
This looks like a slight zigzag but keeps distances short.
The alternative is **11 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3**.
Then **12** is skipped or we have to backtrack **1 -> 12**? No.
If we do **11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 1**.
Then from 1, we must go to the rest of the bottom chain.
The bottom chain starts at 6.
**1 -> 6**? That crosses the path of 3.
**1 -> 9**? Crosses 3-6.
**1 -> 3 -> 6**?
So: **...4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6...**
Visually check **15 -> 1**. 15 is far left. 1 is center. 3 is between them but lower.
**15 -> 3 -> 1** is smoother than **15 -> 1 -> 3**.
So if we end up at 1, where do we go?
**1 -> ...**
We need to connect to the bottom left group (6,9,7).
We established the order **3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10**.
If we arrive at 1 from 3 (**15 -> 3 -> 1**), we are stuck.
If we arrive at 3 from 1 (**... -> 1 -> 3 -> 6...**), we need to get to 1.
The previous point is likely from the 5/11 cluster.
**11 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3**.
Let's check distance **5 -> 1** (short) and **1 -> 3** (moderate).
This seems valid.
What about 12?
We skipped 12 in the sequence **11->5->1**.
So it must be **12 -> 15**.
How do we get to 12?
**5 -> 12**?
So **11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12**.
Distance **11 -> 1** (moderate). **1 -> 5** (short). **5 -> 12** (moderate).
This looks optimal for the center-top area.

Let's verifying the full loop with this logic:
**8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13**.
And finally **13 -> 8**. This closes the loop nicely on the right side.

Let's review the **11 -> 1 -> 5** vs **11 -> 5 -> 1** choice.
1 is south of 5. 11 is east of 5.
Triangle 1-5-11.
If we come from 4 (north of 11), we hit 11.
To go to 12 (west of 5):
Path A: **11 -> 5 -> 12** (direct). Where does 1 go? 1 must be attached to 5 or 3 or 13.
If 1 is attached to 13: **13 -> 1 -> 5**... but we established 13 links to 8 and 2. Inserting 1 there (**13->1->8** or **2->1->13**) is a huge detour.
If 1 is attached to 3: **3 -> 1**.
Then we have **11 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...** where?
We need to get to 6. **1 -> 6** is bad.
So 1 must be integrated into the 5/11 cluster flow.
We need to enter the 1/5/11 group from the right (4) and leave to the left (12).
Entry: 4 -> 11. Exit: 5 -> 12.
Inside the group, we need to pick up 1.
So **11 -> 1 -> 5**.
Does **11 -> 5 -> 1** work? Then **1 -> 12**? No, 1 is further from 12 than 5 is.
So **11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12** is the most efficient local path.

Let's re-verify the bottom left: **15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7**.
15 is top-left. 3 is mid-left. 6 is bottom-left-far. 9 is bottom-left-near. 7 is bottom-center.
**15 -> 3**: clear.
**3 -> 6**: clear.
**6 -> 9**: clear.
**9 -> 7**: clear.
This segment is solid.

Let's re-verify the bottom right: **7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13**.
**7 -> 10**: clear.
**10 -> 2**: clear.
**2 -> 13**: clear.
This segment is solid.

Let's re-verify the top right closing: **13 -> 8**.
13 is mid-right (low). 8 is top-right.
The distance is long, but necessary to close the loop on the perimeter.
Is there an alternative?
Could we go **13 -> 1 -> ...**? No, 1 is too far left.
Could we go **2 -> 8**? No, 13 is in the way.
So **13 -> 8** is the edge.

Final check of the full sequence:
**8, 14, 4, 11, 1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13**.

Let's write it down starting from 1 for convention, or any point. The prompt asks for a list. I will provide the list starting from point 8 as traced, or maybe point 1 to be standard? The prompt example starts with 1. I'll start with the lowest number, 1.

Path order:
**1 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13 -> 8 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11**.
And **11 -> 1** closes it.
Wait, previously I said **11 -> 1 -> 5**.
Let's check the distance **11 -> 1** vs **4 -> 1**.
The sequence was **...14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 5...**
So 1 is visited after 11.
If I start the list at 1, the order is:
**1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11**.
Let's check the closing edge **11 -> 1**.
This edge is moderate length.
The previous incoming edge was **4 -> 11** (short).
This seems correct.

Let's consider if **1 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14 -> 8 -> 13 -> 2 -> 10 -> 7 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 1** is better.
Closing edge **5 -> 1** is very short.
Let's trace:
**1 -> 11** (ok)
**11 -> 4** (ok)
**4 -> 14** (ok)
**14 -> 8** (ok)
**8 -> 13** (long)
**13 -> 2** (ok)
**2 -> 10** (ok)
**10 -> 7** (ok)
**7 -> 9** (ok)
**9 -> 6** (ok)
**6 -> 3** (ok)
**3 -> 15** (ok)
**15 -> 12** (ok)
**12 -> 5** (ok)
**5 -> 1** (short)
This loop is essentially the reverse of the one I derived, with the connection **5-1** closing it instead of **11-1**.
My previous path was **...11 -> 1 -> 5...**. This uses edges **11-1** and **1-5**.
The reverse path I just traced uses **5-1** and **1-11**.
They are the same set of edges.
The order is just reversed.
So: **1, 11, 4, 14, 8, 13, 2, 10, 7, 9, 6, 3, 15, 12, 5**.

Let's double check if **11 -> 1** is better than **11 -> 5**.
In the path **...11 -> 1 -> 5...**: edges are (11,1) and (1,5).
In a path **...11 -> 5 -> 1...**: edges are (11,5) and (5,1).
Visually, 1 is below 5. 11 is to the right.
(11,5) is roughly horizontal.
(5,1) is vertical.
(11,1) is diagonal.
Triangle inequality: Is dist(11,5) + dist(5,1) < dist(11,1) + dist(1,X)? No, we are comparing a segment of the path.
Path A: Enter at 11 -> 1 -> 5 -> Exit at 12. Total length: dist(11,1) + dist(1,5) + dist(5,12).
Path B: Enter at 11 -> 5 -> 1 -> Exit at 3 or something?
If we do **11 -> 5 -> 1**, we are at 1. The nearest neighbors are 3 and 13.
Dist(1,3) is larger than Dist(5,12).
Dist(1,13) is moderate.
If we go **11 -> 5 -> 1 -> 13**:
Then we break the **2-13-8** chain. We would have to go **2-10-7...** and handle 8 separately.
So **1 -> 5 -> 12** is the best way to move left.
So the sequence **1, 5, 12** is solid.
This implies 1 must come from 11.
So the sequence is **11, 1, 5, 12**.

So the list is:
**1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11**

Let's re-verify the start point to ensure I don't give a rotated answer that looks weird.
It's a cycle, so it doesn't matter. I'll start with 15 just to trace it on the screen top to bottom.
15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11, 1, 5, 12.
This looks extremely coherent.
Let's try one other permutation around 1/5/11 just in case.
What if **4 -> 11 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3**?
Then **15 -> 12** must connect to something.
**12 -> 5** is used? No, 5 is visited.
**12 -> 4**? No.
**12 -> 11**? No.
So **12 -> 15** is an isolated pair unless connected to 5.
So **5 -> 12** is a must.
Therefore, the sequence must go through 5 to 12.
So **... -> 5 -> 12**.
To get to 5, we must come from 1 or 11.
If we come from 11: **11 -> 5 -> 12**. Then 1 is stranded.
So we must come from 1: **1 -> 5 -> 12**.
To get to 1, we must come from 11 (closest remaining).
So **11 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12**.
This confirms the sequence.

Final check of the list numbers.
1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11

Re-reading the image numbers to ensure no typos.
Top row: 12, 4, 14, 8
Mid-high: 15, 5, 11
Center: 1
Mid-low: 3, 13
Bottom left: 6, 9
Bottom center: 7
Bottom right: 10, 2

Correct labels used.

Sequence:
1 (center)
5 (mid-high, near 1)
12 (top-left)
15 (mid-left)
3 (mid-low left)
6 (bottom-left far)
9 (bottom-left near)
7 (bottom center)
10 (bottom right near)
2 (bottom right far)
13 (mid-low right)
8 (top right far)
14 (top right near)
4 (top center)
11 (mid-high near)
-> back to 1.

The connections are:
1-5: Very short.
5-12: Medium.
12-15: Medium.
15-3: Medium.
3-6: Medium.
6-9: Short.
9-7: Medium.
7-10: Longish.
10-2: Medium.
2-13: Medium.
13-8: Long. (This is the "return" leg of the convex hull).
8-14: Short.
14-4: Medium.
4-11: Short.
11-1: Medium.

Could we improve **13-8**?
Maybe **2 -> 10 -> 13 -> 1 -> 5 ... 4 -> 14 -> 8 -> ?**
If we end at 8, we need to close to 2 (really far) or 10.
If we go **13 -> 1**, we skip 2? No, **2 -> 13**.
So **2 -> 13 -> 1**.
Then **1 -> 5 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14 -> 8**.
From 8, we need to go to 12? **8 -> 12** is very long.
From 8, we need to go to 15? Very long.
So the loop **8 -> 13** or **8 -> 14** is constrained by the corner position of 8.
8 only has 14 and 13 as reasonable neighbors.
So 8 must be connected to 14 and 13.
Therefore the sequence ...**13-8-14**... or ...**14-8-13**... is mandatory.
This confirms the leg **13-8**.

Could we improve **7-10**?
Maybe **9-7-2-10**? No, 7 to 2 is longer than 7 to 10. And 10 to 13 is good.
Maybe **9-7-1-?** No, 7 to 1 is crossing the middle messily.
7 is on the perimeter. 10 is the next point on the perimeter.
So **7-10** is optimal.

Could we improve **15-3**?
Maybe **15-1-3**?
**15-1** is longer than 15-3.
And 1 is better used connecting 11 and 5.
So **15-3** is optimal.

The solution seems robust.

Output list:
1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11

Wait, let's double check the **9-7-10** vs **6-9-7**.
**6-9-7** is definitely right.
Is **7-10-2** right?
7 is bottom center. 10 is bottom right. 2 is bottom right corner.
10 is between 7 and 2?
Let's look at the Y coordinates. 7 is lowest. 2 is lowest. 10 is slightly higher.
X coordinates: 7 < 10 < 2.
So **7 -> 10 -> 2** is a smooth line.
Is **7 -> 2 -> 10** better?
7 to 2 is longer. 2 to 10 is backtracking left. 10 to 13 is up.
**7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13** makes a nice U-turn.
10 is roughly on the line between 7 and 13? No, 10 is below 13.
10 is "inside" the corner of 2?
Actually, 2 is the corner. 10 is slightly inside/left.
So **7 -> 2** cuts off 10. **2 -> 10** goes back. **10 -> 13** goes up.
This would form a self-intersecting loop or a sharp acute angle at 2.
**7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 13** keeps the perimeter property (convex hull).
So **7-10-2-13** is correct.

Final check.
1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11

The prompt asks for a comma-separated list.
I will output the sequence starting at 1.

1, 5, 12, 15, 3, 6, 9, 7, 10, 2, 13, 8, 14, 4, 11
