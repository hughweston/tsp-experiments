Based on a visual analysis of the points to find the shortest path connecting them all in a single loop (Traveling Salesman Problem), here is the optimal route:

1.  **Start at point 7** on the far left.
2.  Move diagonally up to **point 6**.
3.  Continue slightly up and right to **point 10**.
4.  Go up and left to **point 2**.
5.  Cross over to the top right to **point 1**.
6.  Move down slightly to **point 4**.
7.  Continue down and left to **point 9**.
8.  Go left to **point 3**.
9.  Travel down to **point 8**.
10. Finally, go to the bottom-most **point 5**.
11. (The path would then loop back to 7 to close the circuit).

**Sequence:**
7, 6, 10, 2, 1, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5

*(Note: The reverse order 5, 8, 3, 9, 4, 1, 2, 10, 6, 7 is also a valid and equivalent answer.)*
