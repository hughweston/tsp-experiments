Based on visual inspection of the points to find the shortest path connecting them all in a loop (Traveling Salesman Problem), the optimal tour follows the outer "ring" of points.

Here is the step-by-step path:
1.  Starting at the top left area, go from **7** to **1**.
2.  Continue clockwise to **3**, then **2**.
3.  From 2, the path likely goes down towards the middle to **9**, but looking at the overall shape, it's more efficient to sweep across the top and then down the right side. Let's re-evaluate. The points form a rough C-shape or loop.
4.  Let's trace the perimeter: **7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 9** looks like a diversion. Let's try to keep the loop open.
5.  Actually, looking at the distances:
    - **7** is close to **1**.
    - **1** is close to **3**.
    - **3** is close to **2**.
    - **2** is somewhat isolated but closest to **9** or **10**. However, **9** is very central.
    - Let's look at the bottom: **6** is far left. **4** is bottom-middle. **5** is bottom-right. **10** is mid-right.
    - Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep starting from the far left **6**.
    - From **6**, go to **8**.
    - From **8**, go up to **7**.
    - From **7**, go to **1**.
    - From **1**, go to **3**.
    - From **3**, go to **2**.
    - From **2**, go down to **10**. (Note: 9 is in the middle, creating a potential crossing or detour).
    - From **10**, go down to **5**.
    - From **5**, go left to **4**.
    - Now, where does **9** fit? The gap between 2 and 10 is large. The gap between 4 and 6 is large. Point 9 is central.
    - Let's re-examine the connection around **9**. Point 9 sits between the top cluster (1,3,2) and the bottom cluster (4,5). It is also reachable from 8.
    - Let's look for the nearest neighbors for each point to build the chain.
        - 6 is closest to 4 or 8. Let's connect **6-8**.
        - 8 is closest to 7. Connect **8-7**.
        - 7 is closest to 1. Connect **7-1**.
        - 1 is closest to 3. Connect **1-3**.
        - 3 is closest to 2. Connect **3-2**.
        - Now we have the chain 6-8-7-1-3-2.
        - From 2, the closest is 9. Let's try **2-9**.
        - From 9, where to next? 10 is to the right, 4 is below. 10 seems closer to 2, but we already used 2. 9 is reasonably close to 10. Let's try **9-10**.
        - From 10, go down to **5**.
        - From 5, go left to **4**.
        - From 4, close the loop back to **6**.

    - Let's check an alternative for the middle section.
        - Chain: 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2.
        - Instead of 2->9, maybe 2->10? If 2->10, then 10->5->4... then we have to grab 9. 4->9->6? No, 9 to 6 is very far. 9 needs to be integrated between the top and bottom or right side.
        - The position of 9 suggests it bridges the top and bottom.
        - Let's try: 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6? No, 9 to 6 is a long jump crossing the path of 8-6.
        - Let's try incorporating 9 into the middle right: 2 -> 9 -> 10? Visually, 2-9 and 9-10 are shorter segments than 2-10 directly.
        - So the path 2 -> 9 -> 10 seems robust.
        - Then 10 -> 5.
        - Then 5 -> 4.
        - Then 4 -> 6.

Let's trace this full loop: **6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 4 -> (back to 6)**.
- 6 to 8: Short edge.
- 8 to 7: Short edge.
- 7 to 1: Short edge.
- 1 to 3: Short edge.
- 3 to 2: Short edge.
- 2 to 9: Medium edge.
- 9 to 10: Medium edge.
- 10 to 5: Medium/Long edge.
- 5 to 4: Long edge.
- 4 to 6: Long edge.

Is there a better way to handle the bottom?
Maybe 4 is connected to 9? If 9 -> 4, then 4 -> 5 -> 10? Then 10 to 2? This would mean the loop is ...-> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 4 -> 9 -> (where? back to 6? 9 is far from 6). This leaves 6 isolated.

Let's reconsider the 6-4 connection. 6 is quite far from 4. 6 is closer to 8 and maybe 4. Is there a way to avoid the long 4-6 edge?
Maybe the order is ...8 -> 6 -> 4...?
Let's try: 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> (back to 7).
- 7 to 8: Good.
- 8 to 6: Good.
- 6 to 4: Long, but probably necessary as 6 is a corner.
- 4 to 5: Long.
- 5 to 10: Medium.
- 10 to 9: Medium.
- 9 to 2: Medium.
- 2 to 3: Good.
- 3 to 1: Good.
- 1 to 7: Good.

This looks like the most logical convex hull traversal with an indentation for point 9.

Let's verify the "indentation" at 9.
Does 2 -> 10 -> 9 -> 4 make sense?
Distance 2-10 is long. Distance 10-9 is medium. Distance 9-4 is medium.
Distance 2-9 is shorter than 2-10.
Distance 9-10 is reasonable.
So 2 -> 9 -> 10 is likely better than 2 -> 10 -> 9.
What about 5? 10 -> 5 is standard. 5 -> 4 is standard.
So the sequence 2 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 4 seems optimal for the right/bottom side.

Let's verify the start.
7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2. This is the tightest cluster.
8 -> 7 is the clear connection for 8.
6 -> 8 is the clear connection for 6.
4 -> 6 connects the bottom to the left.

So the final order is:
6, 8, 7, 1, 3, 2, 9, 10, 5, 4

Let's double check if 4->9->10->5 is better?
If 4->9, then 6->4->9. Then 9->2 or 9->10?
If 9->2, we have ...3->2->9... leaving 10 and 5 stranded.
If 9->10, we have ...9->10->5... then 5 needs to go to 2? 5 to 2 is very far.
So 9 sits best between 2 and 10.

Final check of the loop:
6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.

Path segments:
6-8 (Short)
8-7 (Short)
7-1 (Short)
1-3 (Short)
3-2 (Short)
2-9 (Medium)
9-10 (Medium)
10-5 (Medium)
5-4 (Medium/Long)
4-6 (Medium/Long)

This outlines the perimeter with the necessary detour into the center for point 9.

**6, 8, 7, 1, 3, 2, 9, 10, 5, 4**
