To find the shortest tour for this Traveling Salesman Problem instance, I will trace a path that connects nearest neighbors to form a continuous loop, minimizing the total distance traveled.

Here is a logical path following the visual clusters and distances:

1.  Let's start at point **17** at the top.
2.  Moving left, the nearest neighbor is **5**.
3.  Continuing left/down, we reach **4**.
4.  Moving right, the next closest is **9**.
5.  Dropping down slightly is **18**.
6.  Further down and left is **2**.
7.  Moving right from 2, we hit **7**.
8.  Slightly up and right is **12**.
9.  From 12, looking at the center group, **3** is the best entry point.
10. Just below 3 is **20**.
11. Below that is **8**.
12. Further down is **10**.
13. Now moving to the bottom edge, we go to **6**.
14. Moving right along the bottom is **19**.
15. Moving up from the bottom right, we encounter **1**.
16. Above 1 is **14**.
17. To the right is **16**.
18. Up and slightly left is **13**.
19. Moving left is **11**.
20. Finally, left again to **15**, which connects back to our start point (17) to complete the loop.

This path traces a logical counter-clockwise (or clockwise depending on perspective) loop that avoids crossing lines and connects local clusters efficiently.

**Tour:**
17, 5, 4, 9, 18, 2, 7, 12, 3, 20, 8, 10, 6, 19, 1, 14, 16, 13, 11, 15
