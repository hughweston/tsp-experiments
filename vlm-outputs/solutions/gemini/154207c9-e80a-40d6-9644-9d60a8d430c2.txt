To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for this set of points, I need to find the path that connects all numbered dots with the minimum total travel distance. By visually inspecting the spatial arrangement of the points, I can trace a logical path that moves from one nearest neighbor to the next, minimizing large jumps across the space.

Here is the step-by-step visual tracing of the shortest path:

1.  **Start at point 11** on the far left.
2.  Move down to the nearest point, **10**.
3.  Continue moving down and slightly right to **15**.
4.  Move further down to the bottom-most point, **2**.
5.  Travel right along the bottom edge to point **6**.
6.  Move slightly up and right to **8**.
7.  Continue up to **7**.
8.  Move up and slightly left to **4**.
9.  Continue left to the nearby point **5**.
10. From 5, the most logical next step is inward to point **14**.
11. From 14, move up to **9**.
12. From 9, move left and up to **3**.
13. From 3, travel right to **12**.
14. Continue right and up to the top-most point, **13**.
15. Finally, move down to **1**. (From 1, the loop would close by returning to the start, but looking at the global structure, a different connection might be better. Let's re-evaluate the connection between the right side and the top/left).

**Alternative "Convex Hull" Strategy:**
Let's try following the outer boundary (convex hull) and filling in the interior points efficiently.

- Start at **11** (leftmost).
- Go to **3** (top left).
- Go to **12**.
- Go to **13**.
- Go to **1**.
- Go to **4**.
- Go to **5**. No, 4 to 7 is better. Let's trace the outer ring: 11 -> 3 -> 12 -> 13 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11.
- This leaves the inner points **9** and **14** and **5** unvisited. We need to insert them.
- **Insert 5:** Between 1 and 4? No. Between 4 and 14? 5 is very close to 4. Let's group 4 and 5.
- **Insert 9 and 14:** They are in the middle.

**Let's try a "Nearest Neighbor" approach starting from a specific point:**
1.  Start at **2** (bottom).
2.  Go to **6** (nearest neighbor to the right).
3.  Go to **8**.
4.  Go to **7**.
5.  Go to **1** (up from 7).
6.  Go to **13** (up and left from 1).
7.  Go to **12** (left from 13).
8.  Go to **3** (left from 12).
9.  From 3, the nearest unvisited point is **9**.
10. From 9, go down to **14**.
11. From 14, go right to **5**.
12. From 5, go right to **4**. (Wait, 4 is far from 5? No, 4 and 5 are next to each other). Let's check the map again. 4 and 5 are neighbors.
    *   Correction: From 14 -> 5 -> 4.
    *   From 4, where do we go? We've already visited 1, 7... and the loop needs to close.
    *   We haven't visited the left side (10, 11, 15).
    *   This path is getting stuck.

**Let's try a continuous loop approach again:**
1.  **11** -> **10** -> **15** -> **2** -> **6** -> **8** -> **7**. (This sweeps the bottom edge well).
2.  From **7**, move up to **4**.
3.  From **4**, move left to **5**.
4.  From **5**, move to **14** (nearby interior point).
5.  From **14**, move up to **9**.
6.  From **9**, move to **3** (top leftish).
7.  From **3**, move to **12**.
8.  From **12**, move to **13**.
9.  From **13**, move to **1**.
10. From **1**, the path needs to close back to **11**. Is 1 to 11 a short connection? No, it's very long across the graph.

**Let's look for a bridge that connects the loop better.**
Maybe the "inner" points 9, 14, 5 should be visited on the way "back".

Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep starting from the top right:
**13 -> 12 -> 3**.
From 3, go down to **11**.
From 11, go to **10**.
From 10, go to **15**.
From 15, go to **2**.
From 2, go to **14** (cut inside)? No, **6** is closer. Let's stick to the edge.
**2 -> 6**.
**6 -> 8**.
**8 -> 7**.
**7 -> 4**.
**4 -> 5**.
**5 -> 14**.
**14 -> 9**.
Now we are at 9. We need to connect to 1 and close the loop at 13.
From 9, go to **1**.
From 1, go to **13**. This works fairly well.
Is 9 close to 1? Yes.
Is 1 close to 13? Yes.
Is the start (13) close to the end (1)? Yes.

Let's re-verify the sequence:
**13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9, 1**

Let's check the link **3 -> 11**: It's a bit long but seems necessary to bridge the gap.
Let's check **4 -> 5**: Very short. Good.
Let's check **5 -> 14**: Short. Good.
Let's check **14 -> 9**: Short. Good.
Let's check **9 -> 1**: Reasonable distance.
Let's check **1 -> 13**: Good.

Is there a better way to handle the left side?
Maybe **3 -> 9 -> 14...**?
If we go **3 -> 9**, we skip the far left. We have to visit 11, 10, 15 eventually.
It's hard to visit 9 and 14 without creating a detour if we don't do it in the middle of a sweep.

Let's try inserting the inner points (9, 14) into the left-side sequence.
Path: ... **3 -> 9 -> 14 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11** ... then loop back?
From 11 to 3 is the return. That's a criss-cross. Bad.

Let's try the sequence:
**13, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 14, 10, 11, 3, 9, 12** -> back to 13.
- **15 -> 14**: This looks like a reasonable jump.
- **14 -> 10**: Also reasonable.
- **10 -> 11**: Very short.
- **11 -> 3**: Long jump.
- **3 -> 9**: Reasonable.
- **9 -> 12**: Reasonable.
- **12 -> 13**: Short.
This leaves a crossing or long jump at 11->3.

Let's reconsider the standard outer loop with an indentation for the middle.
The points naturally form a C-shape or a spiral.
Let's trace:
1.  **1**
2.  **7** (1 to 7 is a bit long, but 4 is closer. Let's do 1->4).
3.  **1 -> 4**
4.  **4 -> 5**
5.  **5 -> 14**
6.  **14 -> 2** (bit of a jump). Maybe **14 -> 15**? Let's check image. 14 is somewhat central. 15 is bottom left. 2 is bottom center. 14 is closer to 15 than 2? Hard to say. 14 looks closer to 15.
7.  Let's try: **5 -> 14 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11 -> 3 -> 9 -> 12 -> 13 -> 1 -> ...**
    Where do the bottom right points (2, 6, 8, 7) fit?
    We missed them.

Let's stitch it together differently.
Start **13 -> 12 -> 3**.
From **3**, go to **9**.
From **9**, go to **11**? No, 9 is central. 11 is far left.
From **3**, go to **11**.
**11 -> 10**.
**10 -> 15**.
**15 -> 14**. (Moving inward).
**14 -> 2** is a stretch. Maybe **15 -> 2** is better.
Let's stick to the perimeter: **15 -> 2**.
**2 -> 6**.
**6 -> 8**.
**8 -> 7**.
**7 -> 4**.
**4 -> 5**.
Now we are at 5. We have visited the whole perimeter except the top right loop closure.
Unvisited: **9, 14**. We are at 5. 5 is close to 14.
**5 -> 14**.
From **14**, go to **9**.
From **9**, go to **1**.
From **1**, go to **13**.
(And 13 connects back to 12).
This creates the tour: **12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9, 1, 13**.
Let's check the connection **13 -> 12**. Very short. Good.
Let's check the full loop.
12 -> 3: Good.
3 -> 11: Longest link probably. But necessary to get to the isolated left cluster.
11 -> 10: Good.
10 -> 15: Good.
15 -> 2: Good.
2 -> 6: Good.
6 -> 8: Good.
8 -> 7: Good.
7 -> 4: Good.
4 -> 5: Good.
5 -> 14: Good.
14 -> 9: Good.
9 -> 1: Good.
1 -> 13: Good.
13 -> 12: Good.

This seems to be the optimal visual path. It basically outlines the shape and dips into the center (9, 14, 5) at the appropriate time to connect the right side to the top.

Let's double check if visiting 9 earlier is better.
e.g. 12 -> 9 -> 3 -> 11...
If 12 -> 9, then 9 -> 3. Then 3 -> 11.
This puts 9 between 12 and 3.
Geometrically, 9 is below the line between 3 and 12. Visiting it here might add detour distance compared to visiting it on the way up from the bottom.
In the previous path (14 -> 9 -> 1), 9 acts as a bridge from the center-bottom up to the top-right. This feels more efficient because 9 sits nicely between 14 and 1.

Let's double check if visiting 14 earlier is better.
e.g. 15 -> 14 -> 2...
15 -> 14 is okay. 14 -> 2 is longer than 15 -> 2.
15 -> 2 is a straight line along the bottom edge. Diverting to 14 is a detour.
It is better to visit 14 from 5 or 9.
5 and 14 are very close. It makes sense to link them.

So the sequence **4 -> 5 -> 14** or **14 -> 5 -> 4** is a strong cluster.
We approach this cluster from 7 (to 4) or 9 (to 14).
If we come from the bottom right (7), we hit 4 first. So 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14.
Then from 14, we go to 9.
Then from 9, we go to 1.
Then 1 to 13.

This confirms the sequence:
Start at 13 (arbitrary start):
13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9, 1
(And back to 13).

Let's write it down starting from 1 for simplicity in checking.
1, 9, 14, 5, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 3, 12, 13.
Check the 13 -> 1 link. It is short.
Check the 1 -> 9 link. It is okay.
Check the rest. Looks solid.

Let's verify the "1, 9" vs "1, 13" start.
If I start at 1, go to 13, then 12, then 3...
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9.
Then loop 9 -> 1.
Is 9 -> 1 shorter than 1 -> 13?
1 -> 13 is short.
9 -> 1 is medium.
14 -> 9 is short.
What if we did ... 5, 4, 1, 13, 12, 9 ...?
4 -> 1 is short.
1 -> 13 short.
13 -> 12 short.
12 -> 9 is okay.
9 -> 3 is okay.
3 -> 11 long.
11 -> 10 -> 15 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> ... back to 5.
7 -> 5 is a bit of a jump (crossing 4). Better is 7 -> 4 -> 5.
So if we end at 5, we have to close to 4. But 4 is visited.
This path is broken.

The sequence **7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> 1** effectively "sweeps up" the interior points on the way to the top right.
The alternative would be **7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> 15 -> 14 -> 10 -> 11...**
If we go 15 -> 14, we are at 14.
14 -> 5.
5 -> 4.
4 -> 9? No, 4 to 9 is crossing 5. 4 is "outside". 9 is "inside".
4 -> 1.
1 -> 13 -> 12 -> 3 -> 9??
Then 9 -> 11? No, 9 is far from 11.
So the 14-9-1 bridge seems the most robust way to handle the interior.

Let's try one more variation on the left side.
3 -> 11 -> 10 -> 15.
Is there any reason to go 3 -> 9 -> 14 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11?
14 -> 15 is okay.
15 -> 10 is okay.
10 -> 11 is okay.
11 -> ? We are stuck at the end of a spur. We'd have to go back to 3 or cross to 2.
11 -> 2 is very far.
So 11 and 10 must be visited in sequence with 15 or 3.
Since 11 is an extremity, it must be connected to 3 and 10. (Those are its only reasonable neighbors).
So the segment ...3 - 11 - 10... is fixed.
Similarly, 10 connects to 11 and 15. So ...3 - 11 - 10 - 15... is fixed.
15 connects to 10 and (2 or 14).
2 connects to 15 and 6. (2-14 is possible but 2-6 is the perimeter).
If we do perimeter 15-2-6-8-7-4, we are constrained.
From 4, we go to 5 (nearest neighbor).
From 5, we go to 14 (nearest unvisited).
From 14, we go to 9 (nearest unvisited/upward).
From 9, we go to 1 or 3 or 12.
9 is central.
1 is right.
3 is left.
12 is top.
Looking at the map:
9 is roughly equidistant to 3, 12, 1, 14.
We came from 14.
So we go to 1, 12, or 3.
If we go 9 -> 3, we have to go 3 -> 11... eventually looping back from the right side.
This implies the loop is ...4-5-14-9-3-11-10-15-2-6-8-7...
But then how do we close 7 back to 1 and 13 and 12?
We left out 1, 13, 12.
The segment 13-12-3 is strong.
So if we connect 9 to that top group, it should be 9 -> 1 (then 1-13-12-3...) or 9 -> 12...
Actually, if we look at 9, it sits nicely between 14 and the top group.
If the path is **...5 -> 14 -> 9**, then from 9 we can go to 1 or 3 or 12.
If we go 9 -> 3, we break the 12-3 link or the 3-11 link.
12-3 is strong. 3-11 is the only way to reach 11 efficiently from the top.
So we probably enter the "3" node from 12.
Path: ... -> 12 -> 3 -> 11 -> ...
This means we need to get to 12.
So 9 -> 12?
Path: ...14 -> 9 -> 12 -> 3 -> 11...
Then from the end of the chain (right side, point 1 or 13) we have to close.
If we go 15 -> 2 -> ... -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> 12 -> 3 -> 11 -> 10 -> 15.
This leaves 1 and 13 isolated.
We need to include 1 and 13.
They are near 4 and 12.
Maybe 7 -> 1 -> 13 -> 12 -> 9 -> 3??
7 -> 1 is okay.
1 -> 13 is good.
13 -> 12 is good.
12 -> 9 is okay.
9 -> 3 is okay.
3 -> 11 ... -> 15.
15 -> 14 (cut in).
14 -> 5 (move right).
5 -> 4 (move right).
4 -> ? We are at 4. 4 needs to connect to something.
We started at 7. 4 connects to 7? No, we went 7->1.
4 connects to 2? No.
The neighbors of 4 are 5 and 7.
If we do 5->4->7, then 7 needs to go to 8.
Let's try:
13, 12, 9, 3, 11, 10, 15, 14, 5, 4, 7, 1? No 1 is used.
7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> ?
From 2 we need to get back to 13.
This path is getting convoluted.

Let's stick to the most visually obvious C-shape + interior fill:
**13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9, 1**.
Let's trace the "gaps" again.
- 1 to 13: Standard neighbor.
- 13 to 12: Standard neighbor.
- 12 to 3: Standard neighbor.
- 3 to 11: Largest gap, but necessary.
- 11 to 10: Standard.
- 10 to 15: Standard.
- 15 to 2: Standard.
- 2 to 6: Standard.
- 6 to 8: Standard.
- 8 to 7: Standard.
- 7 to 4: Standard.
- 4 to 5: Standard.
- 5 to 14: Standard.
- 14 to 9: Standard.
- 9 to 1: This is the second largest gap potentially, but 9 is quite central. Distance looks comparable to 3-11.

Let's look for improvements.
Could we do **12 -> 9 -> 14 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11 -> 3** -> (close to 12)?
If we end at 3, we have to close to 12. That works.
Where do 1 and 13 fit?
We missed them.
This right-side group 1, 13 needs to be in the loop.
Maybe **3 -> 13 -> 1 -> ...**?
3 -> 13 is a jump. 3 -> 12 -> 13 is better.
So 12 and 13 are paired.
13 and 1 are paired.
So the sequence **12-13-1** (or reverse) is a strong block.
1 connects to 9 or 4 or 7.
If 1 -> 4, then 4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> ... -> 12. That closes the loop.
Let's trace: **12, 13, 1, 4, 5, 14, 9**. (We have a small loop here).
We need to open this up to include the rest.
Break the 14-9 link? Or 9-12?
Go **9 -> 3 -> 11 -> 10 -> 15 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7**.
From 7, we need to close to 4 (which is connected to 1).
So path: **12, 13, 1, 4, 5, 14, 9, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7**.
From 7, close to 4? But 4 is already visited.
We need to connect 7 to the start (12).
7 to 12 is a huge jump.
So this order is linear but doesn't loop well.

The first sequence I found:
**13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9, 1**.
(Close 1 -> 13).
This looks very robust.
Let's re-verify the 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14 part.
7 is close to 4.
4 is close to 5.
5 is close to 14.
This "inward spiral" hook works perfectly.

Is there any ambiguity?
Maybe **8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 13 -> 12 -> 9 -> 14 -> 5 -> 4 ...**?
From 4, go to... ?
We are stuck inside the loop.
We need to get out to the left side.
We haven't visited 2, 6, 15, 10, 11, 3.
From 4, jump to 2? Long.
From 4, jump to 3? Long.
So getting stuck at 4 or 5 is a risk.
The previous path avoids this by going INTO 4-5-14-9 from the perimeter (7) and getting OUT via 1 or 3.
In my path: ... -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> 1.
We exit the inner hook via 9->1.
This works well.

Final verification of the list order.
Start point doesn't matter. Let's start with 1.
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9
(Back to 1).

Let's do a sanity check on distances.
- 1-13: short
- 13-12: short
- 12-3: medium
- 3-11: long (unavoidable to reach the isolated 11-10-15 strip from the top)
- 11-10: short
- 10-15: short
- 15-2: medium/long (but follows convex hull)
- 2-6: short
- 6-8: short
- 8-7: short
- 7-4: short
- 4-5: very short
- 5-14: short
- 14-9: short
- 9-1: medium

Is there a better way to do the 15-2 transition?
Maybe 15-14-2?
15-14 is short.
14-2 is medium.
Then 2-6...
But then how do we visit 5 and 9?
If we are at 14, we go to 5?
...15-14-5-4-7-8-6-2...
Then from 2, we have to go somewhere. We are at a dead end at 2.
We have visited the whole bottom right cluster.
We need to get to 9, 1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10.
Actually, 2 could connect to 9? Long.
2 could connect to 1? Very long.
So the sequence 2-6-8-7-4-5... seems like the only logical way to traverse that cluster without backtracking.
And 15-2 is the natural bridge to enter that cluster.

Is there a better way to do the 3-11 transition?
Could we go 12-9-3-11?
12-9 is okay.
9-3 is okay.
3-11 is long.
But then we are at 11 -> 10 -> 15 -> 2... -> 14 -> 1?
If we visit 9 early (12-9-3), then 14 is left alone.
After the bottom loop ...4-5-14... we are at 14.
We need to go to 1.
14 to 1 is quite far and crosses other paths potentially. 9 is a much better stepping stone between 14 and 1.
So keeping 9 between 14 and 1 is optimal.
Thus ...14-9-1... is better than visiting 9 early.

This confirms the path:
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

One alternative:
Could 4 and 5 be swapped?
...7 -> 5 -> 4 -> 14?
7 is closer to 4 than 5.
5 is closer to 14 than 4.
So 7-4-5-14 is geometrically smoother than 7-5-4-14.

Could 2 and 6 be swapped?
...15 -> 6 -> 2 -> 8?
15 to 6 is longer than 15 to 2.
2 to 8 is crossing 6.
No, 2-6-8 is the logical convex order.

Could 13 and 12 be swapped?
...1 -> 12 -> 13 -> 3?
1 to 12 is longer than 1 to 13.
13 to 3 is longer than 12 to 3.
So 1-13-12-3 is better.

Final path seems stable.

1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Wait, looking at the image again.
Is 14 closer to 15 or 5?
14 is quite central.
15 is bottom left.
10 is left.
2 is bottom.
5 is center-right.
Visually, 14 is very close to 5.
14 is moderately close to 9.
14 is moderately close to 15.
The link 15->14 is plausible.
If we go 10 -> 15 -> 14 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> ...
From 2, where do we go?
To 9? Long.
To 1? Very long.
So ending at 2 is bad.
We must traverse the bottom arc 15-2-6-8-7 continuously.
So 14 cannot be inserted between 15 and 2.
14 must be visited after the bottom loop (from 5) or before the left loop (from 9).
If we do ...9 -> 14 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11..., then we need to return from 11.
11 -> 3 -> 12 -> 13 -> 1.
Then 1 -> 7 (start of bottom loop).
Is 1 close to 7?
4 is between 1 and 7.
So 1 -> 4 -> 5 (visited? no) -> 7?
Let's trace:
Start 1.
1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11 -> 3 -> 12 -> 13 -> (close to 1).
Where are 5, 14, 9?
We need to insert them.
Best spot for 5 is near 4.
Best spot for 14 is near 5 or 15.
Best spot for 9 is near 12, 3, 14.
Sequence: ...4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> 12?
Let's try:
1 -> 13 -> ?
Let's try the sequence that ends at 12 to close to 13.
... 3 -> 12 -> 13 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> (back to 3?)
9 to 3 is okay.
Is this better?
Path: **13, 1, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 3, 9, 14, 5, 12** -> 13.
5 to 12? Very long. Bad.

What about **13, 12, 9, 14, 5, 4, 1, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 3** -> 13?
3 to 13 is okay (via 12 usually). But 12 is at the start. So 3 to 13 is a jump.
Also 4 -> 1 -> 7 is zig zag. 4 is next to 7. 1 is above.
Better: 1 -> 4 -> 7.
So **13, 12, 9, 14, 5, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 3** -> 13.
Check links:
13-12: good.
12-9: good.
9-14: good.
14-5: good.
5-4: good.
4-7: good (but 4-1-7? We missed 1).
Where is 1?
1 is near 13 and 4.
Insert 1: **13, 1, 4...** or **4, 1, ...**
If 13 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 14 -> 9 -> 12...
Then from 12 we go to 3.
3 -> 11 -> 10 -> 15 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7.
Now we are at 7. We need to close to 13.
7 to 13 is far.
The previous path ended 9 -> 1 -> 13. That was a good closure.
Ending at 7 is a bad closure.
So the "interior first, exterior last" strategy fails on closure.
The "exterior sweep with interior detour" strategy works best.

Final check of the best path:
**13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9, 1**

Let's verify labels one more time from the image.
Leftmost: 11. Below it 10. Below that 15.
Bottom left: 2. Bottom mid: 6.
Bottom right cluster: 8, 7.
Mid right: 4, 5. (5 is left of 4).
Top right: 1.
Topmost: 13.
Top mid: 12.
Top left: 3.
Center-ish: 9, 14. (9 is above 14).

My path:
13 (top) -> 12 (left) -> 3 (left) -> 11 (far left) -> 10 (down) -> 15 (down) -> 2 (right) -> 6 (right) -> 8 (up/right) -> 7 (up) -> 4 (left/up) -> 5 (left) -> 14 (left/down) -> 9 (up) -> 1 (right) -> 13 (up).
This looks perfectly coherent.
Wait, 1 to 13 is up/left. Correct.
9 to 1 is right. Correct.
14 to 9 is up. Correct.
5 to 14 is left/down. Correct.
4 to 5 is left. Correct.
7 to 4 is left/up. Correct.
8 to 7 is up. Correct.
6 to 8 is up/right. Correct.
2 to 6 is right. Correct.
15 to 2 is right. Correct.
10 to 15 is down/right. Correct.
11 to 10 is down. Correct.
3 to 11 is down/left. Correct.
12 to 3 is left/down. Correct.
13 to 12 is left/down. Correct.

Is there any cross over?
3->11 vs 9->1.
Line 3-11 goes from top-left to mid-left.
Line 9-1 goes from center to top-right.
They do not cross.
Line 14-9 vs 5-4.
14-9 is vertical. 5-4 is horizontal. No cross.
Line 5-14 vs 4-7.
No cross.
It seems non-intersecting, which is a property of the optimal TSP tour in 2D Euclidean space.

One potential intersection:
Does 9-1 cross 13-12? No, 13-12 is above.
Does 14-9 cross 4-5? No, 4-5 is to the right.
Does 3-11 cross anything?
It's a long line on the left. The only things to its left are... nothing.
The points 9, 14 are to the right of it.
So it's fine.

The solution seems robust.

Re-formatting the output as requested.
Start from 1.
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Wait, could it be 1, 4, 5, 14, 9, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 13 ?
7->13 is bad.
So sticking to the previous one.

1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Double check 7 -> 4 vs 8 -> 4.
7 is closer to 4 than 8 is. 8 is lower down.
8 -> 7 -> 4 is better than 7 -> 8 -> 4.
Yes.

Double check 4 -> 5 vs 4 -> 14.
4 and 5 are neighbors. 4-5 distance is very small.
4-14 distance is larger.
So visit 5 then 14. Correct.

Double check 3 -> 11 vs 3 -> 10.
11 is "more left" than 10.
Going 3 -> 10 would leave 11 as a spur (10->11, then 11->?).
If 3->10, then 10->11, then 11->15 is a back-track/cross.
So 3->11 (outermost) -> 10 -> 15 is the correct order.

Double check 15 -> 2.
15 -> 14 is also close.
If we go 15 -> 14 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> ...
From 2 we are stuck (far from 9, 1, 13, 12, 3).
So 15 -> 2 is correct.

The tour is solid.

Output list:
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Let me provide the answer starting with 1 for consistency with common examples, although any rotation is valid.

Points: 1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9.

Wait, looking at 9->1.
Is 9->13 better?
If 9->13, then we must do 13->12->... or 13->1->...
If 13->1, then 1->4...
This would be ...14->9->13->1->4...
Distance 9->13 vs 9->1.
1 is to the right of 9.
13 is to the top right of 9.
1 seems closer or similar.
However, 13 connects to 12. 1 connects to 4? No, 1 connects to 13.
In my loop: ...9->1->13->12...
Distance 1->13 is small.
Distance 13->12 is small.
Distance 9->1 is medium.
Total = 9-1 + 1-13 + 13-12.

Alternative: ...9->13->1->4...
Distance 9-13 (medium) + 13-1 (small) + 1-4 (smallish).
Then ...4->5.
This skips 12, 3.
If we do ...9->13->12->3...
Then 1 is left out.
So 1 must be near 13 or 4.
If 1 is connected to 13 and 4...
Loop: ...5->14->9->12->13->1->4...
But 4 is already visited in my main loop (7->4).
So we can't visit 4 again.
So 1 must connect to 13 and 9.
Or 1 must connect to 13 and 7.
7->1 is longer than 7->4.
So 7->4 is preferred.
This leaves 1 attached to 13.
So ...9->1->13->12 is the only logical chain.

Result confirmed.

Final check of the numbers.
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9
Count: 15 points.
Are all points 1-15 included?
1 - yes
2 - yes
3 - yes
4 - yes
5 - yes
6 - yes
7 - yes
8 - yes
9 - yes
10 - yes
11 - yes
12 - yes
13 - yes
14 - yes
15 - yes
All unique.

Start with a more recognizable "start" like the top left? The prompt says "You can start from any point". I will start from 1 as it is the first number.

Sequence: 1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Wait, 4 to 5... 5 is left of 4.
7 is right/down of 4.
Path 8->7->4->5...
Correct.

The solution looks complete and verified.

One final check on point 9.
Is 9 closer to 12 or 1?
Visually, 9 is roughly equidistant.
However, if I go 14->9->12, then 12->13->1->(close loop to 9? no).
Loop must close.
If path is ...14->9->12->3->11...->7->4->5->(back to 14).
Then 1 and 13 are isolated.
We must splice 1 and 13 into the ring.
Between 7 and 12?
7 -> 1 -> 13 -> 12.
This is 7->1 (long) + 1->13 (short) + 13->12 (short).
Vs my path:
7->4...->9->1->13->12.
This is 7->4 (short) ... 9->1 (med) + 1->13 (short) + 13->12 (short).
The 7->1 link is the problem in the first alternative.
Is 7 closer to 1 or 4?
7 is much closer to 4.
So 7->4 is mandatory.
This forces the rest of the chain.

Solution stands.

1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Wait, could 8 go to 6 then 2?
Current: 2->6->8->7.
Alternative: 2->8->6->7?
8 is "outside" 6 relative to 2? No.
2 is bottom left-ish. 6 is right of 2. 8 is right/up of 6.
This is a straight line. 2-6-8.
Going 2-8 crosses 6. Bad.
So 2, 6, 8, 7 is the correct order.

What about 6->7->8?
6 is below 8. 7 is above 8.
7 and 8 are close.
6 is close to 8.
Is 6 closer to 7 or 8?
6 is bottom. 8 is up-right. 7 is further up-right.
Order 6->8->7 is correct. 6->7 skips 8.

Everything looks correct.

Final Output list construction:
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Wait, looking at the image one last time...
Is 7 above or below 4?
7 is below 4.
Is 8 below 7?
8 is below 7.
Is 6 left of 8?
6 is left/down of 8.
So ascending the right side: 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 4.
Yes.

1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Actually, 1 -> 4 is also a viable connection.
If I start 1, 4, 5, 14, 9, 12, 13, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 1?
7 to 1 is the weak link.
My previous loop closes 13 to 12.
...9->1->13->12...
Here the weak link is 9->1.
Is 9->1 weaker than 7->1?
9 is much closer to 1 than 7 is to 1.
So my path is better.

Final check.
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9

Looks good.

One variation:
13, 1, 9, 14, 5, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 3, 12
3->12 ok.
12->13 ok.
This is just the reverse of my path.
My path: 1->13->12->3...
Reverse: 1->9->14...
This confirms the cycle.
The output format requests a list starting from any point. I'll provide the one starting at 1.

Order: 1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9.

Wait, looking at the prompt example: "1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6".
It's just a list.
I will produce the string.

One tiny check on 10, 11, 3.
Is 11->3 better or 10->3?
10 is lower than 11. 3 is higher than 11.
10 to 3 crosses 11.
So 11 is between 10 and 3 in y-axis?
No, 11 is clearly the leftmost point, forming a vertex of the convex hull.
So the path must go through it. 3 -> 11 -> 10. Correct.

Ok, ready.

Answer: 1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9.

Just to be absolutely sure, let's re-read point 14 and 15 position.
14 is labeled below its dot.
15 is labeled right of its dot.
15 is near the bottom-left corner.
10 is above 15.
11 is above 10.
The line 10-15 is vertical-ish.
The line 15-2 is horizontal-ish.
14 is "inside" the corner formed by 10-15-2?
14 is to the right of 10/15.
So 15->14 is a shortcut.
If 15->14->2...
14 to 2 is longer than 15-2?
Visual check: 15 to 2 is the bottom edge. 14 is definitely above that line.
Going 15-14-2 is a triangular detour.
Going 15-2 is straight.
So 15-2 is correct.
This means 14 must be visited from the "top" or "right".
It is visited from 5 and exits to 9.
This is correct.

Final Answer seems stable.

One oddity: Point 6.
Is it closer to 2 or 15?
6 is clearly closer to 2.
Is 8 closer to 6 or 7?
8 is between 6 and 7.
So 6-8-7 is correct.

Done.

1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9.

Let's try one last path just in case:
1 -> 9 -> 14 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> 15 -> 10 -> 11 -> 3 -> 12 -> 13
(Close 13 -> 1).
This is the same loop, just shifted start.
Start 1. Next 9...
This corresponds to my loop in reverse.
Let's see: 1 -> 9 (reverse of 9->1). 9->14 (reverse of 14->9).
So the reverse path is:
1, 9, 14, 5, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 3, 12, 13.
Which direction is "better"?
TSP is symmetric. Direction doesn't matter for distance.
I'll list the one I derived first.
1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9.

Wait, reading the prompt example again.
It doesn't imply direction. Just order.
I will stick with my derived order.

Final verification:
1 to 13: Up-left.
13 to 12: Left.
12 to 3: Left-down.
3 to 11: Left-down (long).
11 to 10: Down.
10 to 15: Down.
15 to 2: Right-down.
2 to 6: Right.
6 to 8: Up-right.
8 to 7: Up.
7 to 4: Left-up.
4 to 5: Left.
5 to 14: Left-down.
14 to 9: Up-right.
9 to 1: Right.
Loop closes 1 to 13.

Wait, 14 to 9 is UP-RIGHT?
14 is center. 9 is above it. Yes.
9 to 1 is RIGHT?
9 is center. 1 is top right. Yes.
1 to 13 is UP-LEFT?
1 is top right. 13 is top center. Yes.
It all works.

What about 3->9?
If 3->9, then 9->14...->5->4->7...
...->7->8->6->2->15->10->11
Then 11->12? No 11->12 is a huge jump.
We need 12 connected to 3 or 13.
In the 3->9 variant, 12 is cut off from 3.
So 12 must be connected to 13 and 9?
Loop: 3->9->12->13->1->4...
Distance 3->9 (med) + 9->12 (med) + 12->13 (short).
Vs my path: 3->12 (med) + 12->13 (short) + ... + 9->1 (med).
Actually 12 is visually between 3 and 13.
3-12-13 is a very natural line along the top edge.
Breaking it to go 3-9-12 or 3-12-9-13 makes no sense.
So 3-12-13 is fixed.
Similarly 13-1 is fixed.
Similarly 15-2-6-8-7 is fixed.
Similarly 11-10-15 is fixed.
The only "play" is in the middle connections:
How to connect {11-10...-7} to {4-5-14} to {9} to {1...3}.
My solution:
{...7} -> {4-5-14} -> {9} -> {1...3-11}.
This connects the end of the bottom chain (7) to the inner block (4,5,14), then to the bridge (9), then to the start of the top chain (1), which wraps around to the start of the left chain (3->11).
This topology is a spiral.
Outer -> Inner -> Bridge -> Outer.
This is optimal.

Final check. 4 is between 7 and 5?
7 is bottom right.
4 is above 7.
5 is left of 4.
So 7->4->5 is natural.
Solution is robust.

Final Answer: 1, 13, 12, 3, 11, 10, 15, 2, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 14, 9
