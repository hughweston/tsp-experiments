To find the shortest tour, I'll visually trace the most logical path connecting nearest neighbors to form a loop.

Here is the step-by-step path reasoning:
1.  **Start at the bottom left** with point **3**.
2.  Move right to the nearest neighbor, **6**.
3.  Continue moving right along the bottom cluster to **2** and **8**.
4.  Just above 2 and 8 is **1**. Let's visit that.
5.  From 1, the path naturally extends to the far bottom-right corner to visit **13**.
6.  From 13, move upwards along the right edge to the cluster containing **12**, **7**, **15**, and **10**. A good sequence here to minimize crossing is **12** -> **7** -> **15** -> **10**.
7.  From the top right (10), move left towards the top center. The next nearest point is **18**.
8.  From 18, there is a large gap to the left, leading to the isolated point **14**.
9.  From 14, drop down towards the center-left. The logical entry is **9**.
10. From 9, go slightly right and down to **4** and then **11**.
11. From 11, the path needs to loop back towards the starting area. Let's head towards the middle-left cluster. **19** is somewhat isolated near the top-middle right, but looking at the map, visiting 19 between 11 and the top cluster (18/12) might have been better. Let's re-evaluate the middle section.

**Revised Path Construction:**
Let's try tracing the "outer hull" and filling in the indentations.

-   **Start Top-Left:** **14**
-   Move **East** to top center: **18**
-   Move **South-East** to the cluster below: **19** seems the best bridge.
-   Continue **East/North-East** to the top-right cluster: **15**, **10**, **7**, **12**.
-   Drop **South** to the bottom-right: **13**.
-   Move **West** along the bottom points: **8**, **2**.
-   Hit the point just inside: **1**.
-   Continue **West** to **6** and then **5** (wait, I missed 5 in the first pass).
-   Go further **West** to **3**.
-   Move **North** up the left side: **20**, **16**, **17**, **9**.
-   Now we need to connect the remaining interior points: **4** and **11**.
    -   From **9**, going to **4** then **11** leads us towards the center right.
    -   From **11**, the closest point to close the loop back to the start/top logic (19 or 18) is tricky.

**Let's try a different, more continuous flow starting from a dense area.**

1.  **Start at 13 (Bottom Right)**
2.  Go left to **8**, then **2**, then **1**, then **6**.
3.  Continue left/down to **5**, then **3**.
4.  Move up the left edge to **20**.
5.  Move slightly in/up to **16**, then **17**.
6.  Move up to **9**.
7.  Move up/left to the far point **14**.
8.  Move across the top to **18**.
9.  This is a critical junction. From 18, we need to go down to the center or right. Let's go right to the top cluster: **10**, **15**, **7**, **12**.
10. Now we have **19**, **4**, **11** left in the middle.
    -   From **12**, go to **19**.
    -   From **19**, go to **11**.
    -   From **11**, go to **4**.
    -   From **4**, we need to close the loop. Where are we relative to the rest?
    -   If we came from **9**, **4** is nearby.
    -   Let's check the connection: 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18...
    -   Or 9 -> 17 is tight.

**Let's optimize the middle section:**
-   **Left cluster:** 20, 16, 17, 9, 5, 3.
-   **Bottom cluster:** 6, 2, 8, 1, 13.
-   **Center cluster:** 4, 11, 19.
-   **Top cluster:** 14, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12.

**Attempting a clean sweep:**
1.  **13** (Bottom right)
2.  **8** -> **2** -> **1** -> **6** (Moving left along bottom)
3.  **5** (up slightly from 6)
4.  **3** (Bottom left)
5.  **20** (Left edge)
6.  **16** -> **17** -> **9** (Moving up the left-center)
7.  **14** (Top left outlier)
8.  **18** (Top center)
9.  **10** -> **15** -> **7** (Top right cluster)
10. **12** (Bottom of top-right cluster)
11. **19** (Moving inward)
12. **11** (Moving down/left)
13. **4** (Moving left)
14. Now, from **4**, the closest point not visited or to close the loop?
    -   Wait, if I go 9 -> 14 -> 18... the link 9->4 is very short. Let's use that.
    -   Path: ...17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14 (dead end). No.

**Let's try weaving the center points (4, 11) into the path.**
Start at **14** (Top Left)
-> **9** (Down)
-> **17** (Down)
-> **16** (Left/Down)
-> **20** (Left)
-> **3** (Bottom Left)
-> **5** (Right)
-> **6** (Right)
-> **2** (Right)
-> **1** (Up/Right - short hop)
-> **8** (Right/Down)
-> **13** (Far Right)
-> **12** (Up/Left - longish jump but 13 is isolated) - *Actually, 13 to 12 is a huge jump. 13 to 11 is closer? No. 13 connects best to 8.*
-> From **13**, maybe loop back to **11**? No, 11 is far.
Let's reconsider the right side. **13** is an outlier. It connects best to **8**.
The top right cluster (**7, 10, 15, 12**) connects best to **19** or **18**.

**Let's refine the "Snake" path:**
1.  **14** -> **18**
2.  **18** -> **10** (Top right)
3.  **10** -> **15** -> **7** -> **12**
4.  **12** -> **19**
5.  **19** -> **11**
6.  **11** -> **4**
7.  **4** -> **9** (This is a good link)
8.  **9** -> **17**
9.  **17** -> **16**
10. **16** -> **20**
11. **20** -> **3**
12. **3** -> **5**
13. **5** -> **6**
14. **6** -> **2**
15. **2** -> **1**
16. **1** -> **8**
17. **8** -> **13**
18. **13** -> **12**? No, that crosses lines.
    -   Let's look at the gap between 13 and the top right.
    -   Maybe **11** connects to **1**? Or **8**?
    -   Let's try: **13** -> **8** -> **2** -> **6** -> **1** (Wait, 1 is above 2). **2** -> **1** -> **4**? (Long jump).

**Let's look for the Nearest Neighbor heuristic starting from 14:**
14 -> 9 (dist ~mid) or 18 (dist ~mid). Visually 18 looks slightly closer or similar. Let's go clockwise.
**14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 13** (11 to 13 is far).
Let's try: **12 -> 13**? No.
Maybe: **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14** (loop break).

**Let's try the "C" shape:**
Start **13**.
**13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1** (1 is nestled there).
**1 -> 5**? (No, 1 is closer to 11 or 4? No, 1 is close to 6 and 2).
Let's do: **13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4**.
Now we need to close **4** to **13**. That is a huge jump across the map. This is not a loop.

**We need a circular flow.**
The points naturally form a loop around the center, with some zig-zags.
Let's trace the perimeter:
**13** -> **8** -> **2** -> **6** -> **5** -> **3** -> **20** -> **16** -> **17** -> **9** -> **14** -> **18** -> **10** -> **15** -> **7** -> **12** -> **19**.
Now we are at **19**. The remaining internal points are **4**, **11**, **1**.
**19** is close to **11**.
**11** is close to **4** and **1**.
Let's re-route the bottom right:
Instead of 2->6->5, how about integrating **1**?
**8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6**? No, 1 is higher. **8 -> 2 -> 6**... **1** is closer to **11**? No, 1 is very close to 2.
Let's assume **1, 2, 8** is a tight group.
**11** is centrally located.
**4** is centrally located.

**Best visual loop:**
1.  Start **14** (Top Left)
2.  Go to **9** (Down)
3.  **9** -> **17** -> **16** -> **20** -> **3** (Left edge down)
4.  **3** -> **5** -> **6** (Bottom edge right)
5.  **6** -> **2** -> **8** -> **13** (Bottom right corner)
6.  From **13**, we must go up. The closest is actually widely separated. Visual trick: Is **13** close to **11**? No. Is it close to **1**? No. It's closest to **8**.
    *Correction*: **13** is an outlier. The tour likely goes **8 -> 13 -> [something]** or **[something] -> 13 -> 8**.
    Looking at the map, **12** is directly above **13**. Is the path **13 -> 12**? It's a long vertical line, but might be necessary to close the right side.
    Let's check the alternative. **13 -> 11**? 11 is quite far left.
    Let's look at **11**. It sits between the bottom cluster and the top right cluster.
    Maybe the path is **8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 ...** ?
    Let's try to bridge the gap from bottom-right to top-right via the middle.
    **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 1**.
    Let's check the connection **1 -> 13**. No.
    Let's check the connection **4 -> 1**. **4** and **1** are somewhat far. **1** is very close to **2**.
    So **1** must be grouped with **2**.

    **Let's regroup:**
    Group A (Bottom): **3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13**
    Group B (Top Right): **12, 7, 15, 10**
    Group C (Top/Mid): **18, 19, 14, 9, 4, 11**
    Group D (Left): **20, 16, 17**

    **Proposed Sequence:**
    1.  **13** -> **8** -> **2** -> **1** (Cluster A)
    2.  **1** -> **11**? (Moving Up). **11** is the closest "next tier" point to **1**.
    3.  **11** -> **4** (Moving Left)
    4.  **4** -> **9** (Moving Left/Up)
    5.  **9** -> **14** (Top Left)
    6.  **14** -> **18** (Top Center)
    7.  **18** -> **19** (Down/Right)
    8.  **19** -> **12** (Right)
    9.  **12** -> **7** -> **15** -> **10** (Top Right Loop)
    10. From **10**, where to? We need to get back to the start.
        If we end at 10, we are stuck.
    Let's reverse the top right. **19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10**. From **10**, can we go to **18**? Yes, but we already visited it.
    Let's swap: **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19**.
    From **19**, go to **11**?
    From **11**, go to **1**?
    From **1**, go to **2, 8, 13**.
    From **13**, where do we go? We need to return to the left side.
    This implies the loop must go **around** the outside.
    **13 -> [long jump] -> ?**
    The only way 13 works is if it is a turnaround point.
    **... -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 ...**
    Distance 8-13 is small. Distance 13-12 is large.
    Is there a point between? No.
    However, visually, the gap between 13 and 12 is the "right edge" of the polygon.
    The gap between 14 and 20 is the "left edge".
    So the tour likely follows the perimeter.

    **Perimeter trace:**
    **14** -> **18** -> **10** -> **15** -> **7** -> **12** -> (gap) -> **13** -> **8** -> **2** -> **1** -> **6** -> **5** -> **3** -> **20** -> **16** -> **17** -> **9** -> **4** -> **11** -> **19**.
    This leaves us at 19. We need to connect 19 to the path.
    19 is near 12 and 18.
    4 and 11 are near the center.
    Let's integrate them.
    **... 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 ...**
    Let's re-stitch:
    **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14**.
    Now check the closure: **14 -> 13**? No way.
    The closure must be **14 -> 9** or similar.
    Let's try starting at **14** and going the other way.
    **14 -> 9**
    **9 -> 4**
    **4 -> 11**
    **11 -> 1**
    **1 -> 2**
    **2 -> 8**
    **8 -> 13**
    **13 -> 6**? No, cross over.
    **13 -> 12**? Let's assume the long vertical right edge is real.
    **13 -> 12**.
    **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10**.
    **10 -> 18**.
    **18 -> 19**.
    **19 -> ...?** Needs to connect to remaining points.
    We missed: **3, 5, 6, 20, 16, 17**.
    This seems disjointed.

    **Let's try the standard "Outer Hull then Insert" approach.**
    Hull: 14-18-10-15-7-12-13-8-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9-14.
    Points inside to insert: **19** (near 12,18,11), **11** (near 1,4,19), **4** (near 9,11), **1** (near 2,11).

    Insertion steps:
    - Insert **19**: Between 18 and 12? **18 -> 19 -> 12**. This looks good.
    - Insert **1**: Between 2 and 6? Or 2 and 8? **2 -> 1 -> 6** creates a zigzag. **8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11...**?
      Let's look at **1, 2, 6, 8**. **1** is slightly above the line 2-8.
      Maybe **8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3**. Where does 1 fit? **2 -> 1 -> 11**? No, 1 is very close to 2.
      Let's insert **1** into the bottom chain: **8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6**? 1 is further from 6.
      Maybe **6 -> 1 -> 2**? No.
      Maybe **11** connects to **1**?
      Let's look at the center hole: **4, 11**.
      **9 -> 4** is a clear neighbor.
      **4 -> 11** is a clear neighbor.
      **11 -> 1** is a decent jump.
      **1 -> 2** is a very short jump.
      So the path segment **9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2** looks very strong.

    Let's build around that:
    ... **17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> ...**
    From **6**, go to **2**? No, we are ending at 2 from the top.
    So **6 -> 2** (reverse).
    Let's try: **9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**.
    From **13**, go to **12** (Long edge).
    **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18**.
    From **18**, we need to grab **19** and return to **14**.
    **18 -> 19 -> 14**? 19 to 14 is a long jump crossing 9.
    Better: **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19**.
    From **19**, where to? **14**? Long.
    From **19**, maybe **11**? We used 11.
    Let's rethink **19**. It's between 18 and 12.
    **18 -> 19 -> 12** is smooth.

    Let's combine these segments:
    Segment 1 (Left/Center): **14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**.
    Segment 2 (Right/Top): **13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19**.
    We have endpoints **19** and **14**. Do they connect? No, **19 -> 14** is bad.
    We missed points: **17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6**.
    These are on the left/bottom.
    Let's attach them to Segment 1.
    Instead of 14->9, let's go **14 -> 17**.
    **14 -> 9** is good, but **9 -> 17** is also good.
    Let's go **14 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6**.
    Now connect **6** to the **1,2,11** chain.
    **6 -> 1**? 1 is closer to 2.
    **6 -> 2**? Yes.
    **2 -> 1**? Yes.
    **1 -> 11**? Yes.
    **11 -> 4**? Yes.
    **4 -> 19**? No, 4 to 19 is a jump over nothing.
    **4 -> ??**
    Maybe the top loop is separate?
    Let's look at **19**. It is close to **4** and **11**? No, **19** is high up. **4** is central. **11** is central.
    Distance 4-19 is medium. Distance 11-19 is medium.
    Distance 12-19 is short.
    Distance 18-19 is short.
    So **19** belongs to the top cluster.
    Sequence: **18 -> 19 -> 12**.

    **New Full Path Attempt:**
    Start **14**.
    **14 -> 18**.
    **18 -> 19**.
    **19 -> 12**.
    **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10** (This makes a tight loop in top right, ending at 10).
    From **10**, go to **15**? No, visited.
    Let's reorder top right: **18 -> 19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10**.
    From **10**, that's a dead end.
    Try: **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19**.
    From **19**, go to **4**? Or **11**?
    From **19**, the next logical cluster is **4/11**.
    Let's go **19 -> 11**.
    **11 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 8**.
    **8 -> 13**.
    From **13**, we need to sweep left. **13 -> 6** is a bit of a stretch but maybe. Or **13 -> 5**?
    Let's look at **13 -> 6**. It passes 8.
    Maybe **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6**?
    **1 -> 6** is a bit far.
    How about **13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6**?
    Then **6 -> 5 -> 3**.
    **3 -> 20**.
    **20 -> 16 -> 17**.
    **17 -> 9**.
    **9 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 14**. (Closing the loop).
    Let's check the links:
    - **19 -> 11**: Good.
    - **11 -> 1**: Good.
    - **1 -> 2**: Excellent.
    - **2 -> 6**: Good.
    - **6 -> 5**: Good.
    - **5 -> 3**: Good.
    - **3 -> 20**: Good.
    - **20 -> 16**: Good.
    - **16 -> 17**: Good.
    - **17 -> 9**: Good.
    - **9 -> 4**: Good.
    - **4 -> 14**: A bit long. **14** is high up. **4** is center.
    - **14 -> 18**: Good.
    
    Is there a better way to connect 4 and 14?
    Maybe **9 -> 14** directly?
    Path: ... **17 -> 9 -> 14**.
    Then from **14 -> 18 ... -> 19**.
    Then from **19**, we need to get to **4**.
    **19 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 11**.
    **11 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**.
    From **13** back to start (bottom left)?
    **13 -> 6** is the weak link here. **13** is very far right. **6** is bottom center.
    The gap is filled by **8, 2, 1**.
    So sequence **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11** pulls us away from the bottom edge (6,5,3).
    We need to visit **6, 5, 3**.
    Where do they fit?
    After **13 -> 8**, if we go to **2**, then **6** is right there.
    **8 -> 2 -> 6**.
    Then **6 -> 5 -> 3**.
    Then **3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9**.
    Then **9 -> 4**.
    Then **4 -> 11**.
    Then **11 -> 1**.
    We have visited 2, so 1 is a dead end?
    Ah, **1** is next to **2**.
    Let's insert **1** between 11 and 2? No, we went 8->2.
    How about: **11 -> 1 -> 2**? But we need to get to 8.
    **11 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13**? 1 to 8 crosses 2.
    Maybe **11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 ...** and **8** is visited separately?
    **13 -> 8 -> 2** is a sharp turn if we then go to 6.
    **13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6**?
    8 to 1 passes 2.
    8 to 2 is direct.
    2 to 1 is direct.
    1 to 6... 1 is "above" 2. 6 is "left" of 2.
    So **8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11** is an upward branch.
    But we need to go left to **6**.
    This suggests a split.
    Maybe the path comes down from **11**:
    **11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6**.
    Then **6 -> 5 -> 3 ... -> 9**.
    Then **9 -> 4**.
    Then **4 -> 19**?
    Then **19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14**.
    Then **14 -> 17**? (Long). Or **14 -> 9** (visited).
    The connection **4 -> 19** is the question. And **14** closure.

    Let's try a different seed.
    **14 -> 9**.
    **9 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 11**.
    **11 -> 19**.
    **19 -> 18**.
    **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12**.
    **12 -> 13** (The long drop).
    **13 -> 8**.
    **8 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 6**.
    **6 -> 5**.
    **5 -> 3**.
    **3 -> 20**.
    **20 -> 16**.
    **16 -> 17**.
    **17 -> 14**.
    Let's check the links:
    - 4->11: Short.
    - 11->19: Medium/Short.
    - 19->18: Short.
    - 18->10: Medium.
    - 10->15->7->12: Short cluster.
    - 12->13: Long. This is the main suspect.
    - 1->6: Medium. (1 is adjacent to 2, 6 is adjacent to 2).
    - 17->14: Medium/Long.

    Can we improve **12 -> 13**?
    How about **11 -> 13**? No.
    How about **1 -> 13**? No.
    It seems **12** or **8** are the only gateways to **13**.
    Actually, **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**.
    Then **13 -> 6** (Long).
    Then **6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18** (Start).
    This has 13->6 (long) and 9->14 (medium).

    Is there a path **13 -> 12** that doesn't involve a long jump? No, they are vertically aligned with nothing in between. The TSP solution likely uses this edge if the graph is partitioned that way.
    Or maybe **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12**?
    Path: **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6** is bad.
    Path: **13 -> 8 -> 6**? No.
    
    Let's reconsider the cluster **1, 2, 6, 8**.
    Optimal local tour: **6 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1** or **6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8** or **6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8**.
    Distances:
    2-1: Very short.
    2-8: Short.
    2-6: Short.
    1-11: Medium.
    8-13: Short.
    So **13-8-2-1-11** is a strong chain moving up.
    This leaves **6**.
    Can we do **13-8-2-6**? Then from **6** go to **5**.
    Then **1** is stranded.
    So **1** must be visited with **2**.
    **13-8-1-2-6**? 8 to 1 is longer than 8 to 2. But manageable.
    **13-8-2-1-6**? 1 to 6 crosses 2. Bad.
    **13-8-2-1-11**? Leaves 6 stranded.
    
    What if we come from the left?
    **5 -> 6**.
    **6 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 8**.
    **8 -> 13**.
    **13 -> 1**. No.
    **13 -> 12**. (The jump).
    **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19**.
    **19 -> 11**.
    **11 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 4**? No, 1 is low. **1 -> 9**? No.
    **1** is the problem.
    It is close to 2 and 11.
    If we connect **11 -> 1 -> 2**, we are good.
    So:
    **... 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**.
    **13 -> 12** (The jump).
    **12 -> ... -> 19**.
    **19 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 9**.
    **9 -> 14**.
    **14 -> 17**.
    **17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6**.
    **6 -> 2**? But we visited 2.
    We need to close the loop at 6.
    Path end: **6**. Path start: **11**.
    We need **6 -> 11**. That's a cross.
    
    **Let's try the "S" curve:**
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**.
    From **13**, we need to go to **6**.
    **13 -> 6** is long.
    **6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 14**? Or **4 -> 18**? **4** is in the middle.
    **9 -> 4** is good. **4 -> 11** is good.
    But we used **11** in the downward stroke.
    
    **Let's try to fix the Middle:**
    Points: **9, 4, 11, 19, 1**.
    9 is left. 19 is right.
    Chain: **9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19**?
    Chain: **19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9**?
    Chain: **19 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1**?
    Let's try **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11 -> 19 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6**.
    Closure: **6 -> 14**? Terrible.
    
    **Back to basics. Follow the numbers visually.**
    Start **14**.
    Go **East** to **18**.
    Go **East** to **10**.
    Go **South** to **15**.
    Go **East** to **7**.
    Go **South** to **12**.
    Go **South** to **13**. (The long edge).
    Go **West** to **8**.
    Go **West** to **2**.
    Go **North-West** (tiny) to **1**.
    Go **North** to **11**.
    Go **North-East** to **19**.
    Go **West** to **4**.
    Go **North-West** to **9**.
    Go **South-West** to **17**.
    Go **West** to **16**.
    Go **South-West** to **20**.
    Go **South-East** to **3**.
    Go **East** to **5**.
    Go **East** to **6**.
    From **6**, we need to close to **14**? No.
    From **6**, we are near **1, 2**.
    We entered the bottom group at **8**.
    Path was ... **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11**.
    This skips **6**.
    We need to put **6** in.
    **... 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 ...**
    Where does **1** go?
    **2 -> 1 -> 11**?
    If we go **8 -> 2 -> 6**, we move away from 1.
    Unless **8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6**?
    Or **13 -> 1 -> 2**? No, 8 blocks it.
    
    **Is it possible 1 connects to 6?**
    Distance 1-6 is moderate.
    Distance 1-2 is tiny.
    Distance 1-11 is moderate.
    Distance 1-8 is short.
    Likely neighbors of 1 are 2 and (8 or 11).
    Likely neighbors of 2 are 1 and (6 or 8).
    Likely neighbors of 8 are 13 and (2 or 1).
    
    Hypothesis: **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> [Back to top]**.
    From **1**, go to **19**? Long.
    From **1**, go to **12**? Long.
    From **1**, go to **... 19** is the only one in that quadrant.
    Maybe **11 -> 19**.
    So **... 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14**.
    Then close **14 -> 9**? We used 9.
    Start at **14**. **14 -> 17**.
    Let's check **14 -> 17**. It's a bit long but valid.
    Let's check **4 -> 9**. Very short.
    Let's check **1 -> 11**. Moderate.
    Let's check **19 -> 12**. Short.
    This creates a loop:
    **14 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> (wait, where does 1 go?)**
    Ah, I missed **4** and **9** in the middle.
    And where does **1** connect? To **4**? Or **9**?
    Let's trace: **11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14**?
    Sequence: **... 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2**.
    Wait, **2** is used.
    I need to insert **1** into the bottom chain.
    **6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13**.
    Then **13 -> 12**.
    Then **12...19**.
    Then **19 -> 11**.
    Then **11 -> 4**.
    Then **4 -> 9**.
    Then **9 -> 14**.
    Then **14 -> 18**.
    Then **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> (we used 12)**.
    This is getting messy.
    
    **Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep from 14.**
    1.  **14**
    2.  **9** (South-Eastish)
    3.  **4** (South-East)
    4.  **11** (South-East)
    5.  **1** (South)
    6.  **2** (South-West)
    7.  **6** (West)
    8.  **5** (West)
    9.  **3** (West)
    10. **20** (North-West)
    11. **16** (North-East)
    12. **17** (North-East)
    13. (From 17 to ?) **18**? Long.
    14. (From 17 to ?) **14**? We started there.
    
    We missed **8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19**.
    We are at **17**.
    Nearest unused is **18** or **19**?
    Maybe **17 -> 19**? No.
    Maybe **14 -> 17** was the start.
    **14 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9**.
    Close **9 -> 14**.
    Let's evaluate the edge lengths:
    - 14-17: Long.
    - 17-16: Short.
    - 16-20: Short.
    - 20-3: Medium.
    - 3-5: Medium.
    - 5-6: Short.
    - 6-2: Short.
    - 2-1: Short.
    - 1-8: Short.
    - 8-13: Short.
    - 13-12: Long. (Unavoidable?)
    - 12-7: Short.
    - 7-15: Short.
    - 15-10: Short.
    - 10-18: Medium.
    - 18-19: Short.
    - 19-11: Short/Medium.
    - 11-4: Short.
    - 4-9: Short.
    - 9-14: Short/Medium.
    
    This looks like a very strong candidate. It has two long edges: **14-17** and **13-12**.
    Can we avoid **14-17**?
    Try **14 -> 18** start.
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19**.
    Close **19 -> 14**? Long.
    Close **19 -> 18**? Short, but 18 is start+1.
    If path is ... **19 -> 18 -> 14**, then 14 is end.
    But **14** connects to **9**. So loop is closed? No, 19 to 9 is bad.
    
    What about **... 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 ...**
    This connects the right side (13) and left side (17).
    The top is **14-18-10-15-7-12**.
    Can we stitch these?
    **14 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10**.
    Close **10 -> 14**? No.
    Close **10 -> 18**? Yes.
    So loop: **18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18**.
    Where is **14**?
    **14** is the outlier on the left.
    It connects to **9** and **18**.
    So insert it there.
    **... 9 -> 14 -> 18 ...**
    Path: **... 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18**.
    Wait, **10 -> 19**?
    Let's check **10, 18, 19**.
    Triangle. **18-10** (top), **18-19** (diag), **10-19**? 19 is below 18. 10 is right of 18.
    **18-19-12** is smooth.
    **10-15-7-12** is smooth.
    So **18-10-15-7-12-19** creates a crossing.
    Better: **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12**. Then **12 -> 13**?
    Or **12 -> 19**.
    If **12 -> 19**, then **19 -> 11**.
    
    Let's reconsider the **14** insertion.
    The loop **14-18-10-15-7-12-13-8-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9-4-11-19-14**
    Edges:
    - 14-18: OK.
    - 18-10: OK.
    - 10-15: OK.
    - 15-7: OK.
    - 7-12: OK.
    - 12-13: Long.
    - 13-8: OK.
    - 8-1: OK.
    - 1-2: OK.
    - 2-6: OK.
    - 6-5: OK.
    - 5-3: OK.
    - 3-20: OK.
    - 20-16: OK.
    - 16-17: OK.
    - 17-9: OK.
    - 9-4: OK.
    - 4-11: OK.
    - 11-19: OK.
    - 19-14: **Very Long and crosses 18**.
    
    We need **19** to connect to **18** or **12**.
    If **19** connects to **18**, we have **... 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14**.
    **18 -> 14** OK.
    **14 -> 9** OK.
    So:
    **10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14**.
    Close **14 -> 10**? **Terrible**.
    Close **14 -> ...**?
    We need to reverse the start.
    **14 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10**.
    Close **10 -> 14**? No.
    
    What if **10** connects to **18**?
    **14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18**.
    Close **18 -> 14**. Good.
    Now we just need to fit the bottom loop.
    We are entering/exiting at **11**, **19**, **12**, **7**...
    Where does the bottom loop connect?
    It connects at **13** (to 12) and at **9** (to 17).
    So:
    **... 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 ...**
    Let's stitch this into the top loop.
    **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18**.
    Edges:
    - 18-10: OK.
    - 10-15: OK.
    - 15-7: OK.
    - 7-12: OK.
    - 12-13: Long.
    - 13-8: OK.
    - 8-1: OK (crosses 2-1?). Visually **8-2-1** is better. Let's assume **8-2-1**.
      - **8 -> 2**: OK.
      - **2 -> 6**: OK.
      - **6 -> 5**: OK.
      - **5 -> 3**: OK.
      - **3 -> 20**: OK.
      - **20 -> 16**: OK.
      - **16 -> 17**: OK.
      - **17 -> 9**: OK.
      - **9 -> 4**: OK.
      - **4 -> 11**: OK.
      - **11 -> 19**: OK.
      - **19 -> 18**: OK.
    - Where is **14**?
      - **14** connects to **9** and **18**.
      - In the path above: **9 -> 4** and **19 -> 18**.
      - Insert **14** between **18** and **9**? No.
      - Insert **14** at the end: **19 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9**.
      - YES. **18 -> 14 -> 9**.
      
    **Final Candidate Path:**
    Start at **14**.
    **14 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4**.
    Close **4 -> 14**.
    Distance **4 -> 14**?
    **4** is at (center). **14** is (top left).
    It crosses **9**.
    But **9** is already visited (14->9).
    This creates a loop crossing itself. **9-17** goes left. **4-14** goes left-up across it.
    
    Correction:
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19**.
    **19 -> 14** (Crosses 18).
    
    Let's refine the **18 -> 14 -> 9** idea.
    **18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4**.
    Close **4 -> 18**.
    **4** is center. **18** is top center.
    The path **4 -> 18** passes right through **19, 11**.
    But **19** and **11** are already visited.
    This works topologically!
    Let's check neighbor distances for **4 -> 18** vs **4 -> 11**.
    We have **11 -> 4**.
    Then **4 -> 18**.
    Distance is medium-long.
    Is there a better closer?
    Maybe **4 -> 19**? Then **19 -> 18**.
    Let's modify the end:
    **... 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 ...**
    Wait, let's stick to the perimeter logic which is robust.
    
    **Robust Perimeter + Infill:**
    1.  **14 -> 18**.
    2.  **18 -> 10**.
    3.  **10 -> 15**.
    4.  **15 -> 7**.
    5.  **7 -> 12**.
    6.  **12 -> 19**. (Infill top right).
    7.  **19 -> 11**. (Infill center).
    8.  **11 -> 4**. (Infill center).
    9.  **4 -> 9**. (Bridge to left).
    10. **9 -> 17**.
    11. **17 -> 16**.
    12. **16 -> 20**.
    13. **20 -> 3**.
    14. **3 -> 5**.
    15. **5 -> 6**.
    16. **6 -> 2**.
    17. **2 -> 1**.
    18. **1 -> 8**.
    19. **8 -> 13**.
    20. **13 -> 14**? **NO**. 13 is bottom right, 14 is top left.
    
    The loop must close.
    The break must be **13 -> 12**.
    Let's assume the path contains **13 -> 12**.
    Then we have **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13**.
    Where are **4, 11, 19**?
    Insert **19**: **18 -> 19 -> 14**? No. **12 -> 19 -> 10**? No.
    **18 -> 19 -> 12**.
    So top part: **14 -> 18 -> 19 -> 10? No. 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19**.
    Insert **4, 11**:
    Connect **9** and **1**.
    **9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1**.
    
    Combined Path:
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 19**? No, 1 to 19 is far.
    Maybe **19** goes with top.
    **14 -> 18 -> 19 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11 -> 4 -> 6? No.**
    
    Let's try the sequence that looks most "circular" on the screen:
    **14, 18, 19, 12, 7, 15, 10** (Top cluster) -> **10 to ?**
    **10, 15, 7, 12, 19, 11, 4, 1, 2, 8, 13** (Right side sweeping down).
    **13, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17, 9, 14, 18**.
    Let's check the links:
    - 14-18: Good.
    - 18-10: Good.
    - 10-15: Good.
    - 15-7: Good.

    - 12-19: Good.
    - 19-11: Good.
    - 11-4: Good.
    - 4-1: Good? **4** is (337, 266). **1** is (386, 461). Dist ~200.
      **11** is (398, 303). **1** is (386, 461). Dist ~160.
      **1** is closer to **11**.
    - 1-2: Good.

    - 20-16: Good.
    - 16-17: Good.
    - 17-9: Good.
    - 9-14: Good.
    
    Is **13-6** the best we can do for the bottom?
    Or **13-1**? Or **13-12**?
    **13-12** is ~250px vertical.
    If we use **13-12**:
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14**.
    Where is **12** and **13**?
    Insert **12** near 7. **7 -> 12**.
    Connect **12 -> 13**.
    Connect **13 -> 8**.
    So: ... **7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6** ...
    Wait, **1 -> 6** is bad? **2 -> 6** is better.
    So **8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6**.
    And where do **19, 11, 4** go?
    **19** is near **7, 12**.
    **7 -> 19 -> 12**.
    So path: **... 15 -> 7 -> 19 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 ...**
    Then loop up left side: **... 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 18 -> 14**?
    **11 -> 18**? 11 is (398, 303). 18 is (361, 38). Distance ~270.
    **11 -> 14**? Far.
    **11 -> 10**? Far.
    So **11** is the cul-de-sac.
    **4** connects to **9**. **11** connects to **4**.
    We need **11** to connect to something else.
    **11** connects to **19** and **1**.
    So chain: **19 -> 11 -> 4**.
    We need to fit this chain into the flow.
    We had **7 -> 19 -> 12**? That breaks the 19->11 link.
    How about **15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1**.
    Then **1 -> 8**? visited. **1 -> 4**?
    **11 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 6**.
    This works!
    Let's trace:
    Start **14**.
    **14 -> 18**
    **18 -> 10**
    **10 -> 15**
    **15 -> 7**
    **7 -> 12**
    **12 -> 19**
    **19 -> 11**
    **11 -> 4**
    **4 -> 9**
    **9 -> 17**
    **17 -> 16**
    **16 -> 20**
    **20 -> 3**
    **3 -> 5**
    **5 -> 6**
    **6 -> 2**
    **2 -> 1**
    **1 -> 8**
    **8 -> 13**
    **13 -> ... 14**? No.
    **13 -> 12**? Already visited.
    This path is not a loop. Ends at 13.
    Requires **13 -> 14** (impossible) or **13 -> 12** (visited).
    
    We need the loop to close.
    The big vertical gap is **12-13**.
    The tour MUST use **12-13**.
    So:
    **13 -> 12**.
    **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10**.
    **10 -> 18**.
    **18 -> 19**.
    **19 -> 11**.
    **11 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 9**.
    **9 -> 14**.
    **14 -> 17**.
    **17 -> 16**.
    **16 -> 20**.
    **20 -> 3**.
    **3 -> 5**.
    **5 -> 6**.
    **6 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 8**.
    **8 -> 13**.
    
    Let's verify edges for "weirdness":
    - **18-19**: good.
    - **19-11**: good.
    - **11-4**: good.
    - **4-9**: good.
    - **9-14**: good.
    - **14-17**: acceptable (this is the closure of the top-left).
    - **1-8**: good.
    - **8-13**: good.
    
    This is a valid tour.
    Let's check if we can improve **14-17**.
    Can we do **14 -> 18** and **9 -> 17**?
    Yes, swap direction of top loop.
    **17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14**.
    From **14**, go to **10**.
    **14 -> 10** is longer than **18 -> 10**.
    So **18** should connect to **10** or **19** or **14**.
    In my path: **10 -> 18 -> 19**. OK.
    
    Can we optimize the bottom right **1, 2, 6, 8**?
    Path: **6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13**.
    **6 -> 2**: short.
    **2 -> 1**: short.
    **1 -> 8**: short.
    **8 -> 13**: short.
    This looks optimal for that cluster.
    
    Final check of the sequence:
    13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9, 14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8.
    
    Start point: 1.
    Order: 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9, 14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2.
    (Then 2->1).
    
    Is **19 -> 11** better than **19 -> 12**?
    In the path **12 -> 7 ... -> 18 -> 19 -> 11**, we use 19 to bridge top and middle.
    If we did **18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11**, that works too.
    My sequence has **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19**.
    Dist(12, 7) vs Dist(12, 19). 12 is closer to 7. 19 is closer to 18.
    So **12-7-15-10-18-19** is better than **12-19...**.
    
    Is **9 -> 14** better than **14 -> 18**?
    My sequence: **9 -> 14 -> 17**.
    Dist(9, 14) + Dist(14, 17).
    Alternative: **9 -> 17** ... **14 -> 18**.
    If we do **9 -> 17**, we need to connect **14** elsewhere.
    **16 -> 14**? No.
    **4 -> 14**? No.
    **14** is a corner. It must connect to its two neighbors: **9** and **18**.
    So sequence **18-14-9** is mandatory.
    
    Let's adjust my sequence to include **18-14-9**.
    Current: **10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17**.
    Change to: **10 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17**? No, **14** is stranded.
    Change to: **10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17**.
    Now we are at **17**. Where to go?
    **17 -> 16 -> 20 ... -> 13 -> 8 -> 1**.
    Wait, **17** connects to **16** and **9**.
    We used **9**.
    So **17** is an end.
    We need to close **17** to something.
    **17 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11**.
    Close **11 -> 17**? No.
    Close **11 -> 16**? No.
    
    Actually, **14** is closer to **17** than **18** is to **17**.
    But **14** is closer to **18** than **17** is to **18**.
    Visually, **14-9** is a radial spoke. **14-17** is the perimeter. **14-18** is the perimeter.
    So **17-14-18** is the hull.
    Then **9** is internal?
    No, **9** is between **4** and **17**.
    So **4 -> 9 -> 17** is good.
    Then **17 -> 14**?
    Then **14 -> 18**.
    This looks correct.
    
    Let's try that:
    **... 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13 -> [Back to start]**.
    Start was **4**.
    End is **13**.
    **13 -> 4**? No.
    We need to fit the bottom loop **6-5-3-20-16**.
    Where does it attach?
    **17** attaches to **16**.
    So **... 16 -> 17 -> 14**.
    **3 -> 20 -> 16**.
    **6 -> 5 -> 3**.
    **2 -> 6**.
    **1 -> 2**.
    **11 -> 1**.
    **19 -> 11**.
    **12 -> 19**.
    **13 -> 12**.
    **8 -> 13**.
    
    So the full chain:
    **8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7**.
    Ends at 7. Starts at 8.
    Close **7 -> 8**? No.
    
    What about **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13**.
    Ends at **13**. Starts at **12**.
    Close **13 -> 12**.
    Where are **4, 9, 11, 19**?
    Insert **19**: **18 -> 19 -> 12**? No, we have 18->14.
    Insert **19**: **12 -> 19 -> 11**.
    Then **11 -> 4 -> 9**.
    Then **9 -> 17**.
    Modified path:
    **12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14 -> ?**
    **12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**. (Right side).
    **13 -> 6**? No.
    **13 -> ?**
    The only way to close **13** is **13-12**.
    So loop must contain segment **12-13**.
    This forces the rest of the graph into a 'C' shape.
    **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6** ... (stuck).
    Or **13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12**.
    Edges check:
    - 14-10: **BAD**.
    - 14-18: Good.
    - 18-19: Good.
    - 19-11: Good.
    - 11-4: Good.
    - 4-9: Good.
    - 9-17: Good.
    - 17-16: Good.
    - 16-20: Good.
    - 20-3: Good.
    - 3-5: Good.
    - 5-6: Good.
    - 6-2: Good.
    - 2-1: Good.
    - 1-8: Good.
    - 8-13: Good.
    - 13-12: Good.
    - 12-7: Good.
    - 7-15: Good.
    - 15-10: Good.
    - 10-18: Good.
    - 18-14: Good.
    
    Wait, I found a loop!
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> (Back to 18)**?
    Check **19 -> 18**. Good.
    Check **19 -> 14**. Bad.
    Check **14 -> 18**. Good.
    So if we end at 19, and start at 14, we need **19->14** or **19->18->...**
    The sequence **19 -> 18 -> 10...** works.
    But where does **14** connect?
    In the list above: **18 -> 14** was the last step.
    Sequence: **10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14**.
    Does **14** connect to **10**? No.
    Does **14** connect to **18**? Yes. (But 18 is used).
    
    Is **14** connected to **17**? Yes (long).
    Is **14** connected to **9**? Yes.
    Is **9** connected to **4**? Yes.
    Is **4** connected to **11**? Yes.
    Is **11** connected to **19**? Yes.
    Is **19** connected to **18**? Yes.
    Is **18** connected to **10**? Yes.
    Is **10** connected to **15**? Yes.
    Is **15** connected to **7**? Yes.
    Is **7** connected to **12**? Yes.
    Is **12** connected to **13**? Yes.
    Is **13** connected to **8**? Yes.
    Is **8** connected to **1**? Yes.
    Is **1** connected to **2**? Yes.
    Is **2** connected to **6**? Yes.
    Is **6** connected to **5**? Yes.
    Is **5** connected to **3**? Yes.
    Is **3** connected to **20**? Yes.
    Is **20** connected to **16**? Yes.
    Is **16** connected to **17**? Yes.
    Is **17** connected to **14**? Yes.
    
    This is the loop:
    **14 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14**.
    
    Let's double check the "weak" links.
    **14-17**: It's the longest link on the left, but seems necessary to close the loop if we follow the hull. The alternative is weaving through the middle (9), but 14 is a corner. 14-9 is an internal spoke. 14-18 is a hull edge.
    If we do **14-9**, then **9-17**, then we need to exit **4**. **4-11-19-18-14**.
    Let's compare:
    Option A: **...16-17-14-9-4-11-19-18...**
    (17-14) + (14-9) + (9-4) ...
    Option B: **...16-17-9-4-11-19-18-14...**
    (17-9) + (9-4) ... (18-14) + (14-17 closure).
    Wait, in Option A, 14 connects 17 and 9. 14 is (131, 145). 17 is (371, 417) - wait no.
    Coordinates approx:
    14: top left.
    17: mid left.
    9: mid-mid left.
    14 is much closer to 9 than to 17.
    17 is closer to 9 than to 14.
    So **14-9-17** is better than **14-17**.
    But we need to close the loop.
    If we do **14-9-17-16...** then we come back around to **18**.
    **...10-18**.
    Then **18-14**.
    This closes the loop!
    
    Let's verify this path:
    **14 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14**.
    Edge **4 -> 14**.
    **4** is near **9**. **9** is near **14**.
    **4** to **14** crosses **9**.
    Since **9** is visited, this is a visual crossing, not a vertex revisit.
    But dist(4,14) is basically dist(4,9)+dist(9,14).
    It is much better to go **4 -> 9 -> 14**.
    But 9 is used in **9 -> 17**.
    Can we swap?
    **14 -> 18 -> ... -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> ... -> 14**?
    No, that would require **17 -> 14** (Long).
    
    How about **14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> (here is the gap)**.
    We need **18 -> 17**? No.
    We need to connect top (18) to bottom-left (17/16).
    The bridge is **14**.
    So **18 -> 14**.
    Then **14 -> 17** (Long).
    OR **14 -> 9** (Short).
    If **14 -> 9**, then **9 -> 4** ... -> **11** ... -> **1** -> **2** -> **6** -> **5** -> **3** -> **20** -> **16** -> **17**.
    Ends at **17**.
    Must close **17 -> 18**. (Very Long).
    
    So **14-17** (Long) seems unavoidable unless there is a crossing path.
    Let's look at **14-17**.
    14 is top-left. 17 is mid-left.
    20 is far-left. 16 is mid-left.
    Order **14-17-16-20**?
    Or **14-20**? No.
    **14-16**?
    The gap on the left edge is large.
    The gap on the right edge (13-12) is large.
    TSP on random points often has these.
    So **14-17** is likely correct.
    
    Wait, what about **4**?
    In the **14-17...** loop, where is **4**?
    **... 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14**.
    This puts **9** and **4** at the end of the chain.
    **14 -> 17 ... -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14**.
    This works!
    **14** connects to **17** and **9**.
    **9** connects to **4** and **14**.
    **4** connects to **11** and **9**.
    This seems the most logical sequence.
    
    Final sequence construction:
    Start **14**.
    **14 -> 17**.
    **17 -> 16**.
    **16 -> 20**.
    **20 -> 3**.
    **3 -> 5**.
    **5 -> 6**.
    **6 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 8**.
    **8 -> 13**.
    **13 -> 12**.
    **12 -> 7**.
    **7 -> 15**.
    **15 -> 10**.
    **10 -> 18**.
    **18 -> 19**.
    **19 -> 11**.
    **11 -> 4**.
    **4 -> 9**.
    **9 -> 14**.
    
    Let's check the alternative for **14-17**.
    Is **18-19-11-4-9-17-16...** better?
    Ends at ...**13-12-7-15-10-18**.
    This replaces **14-17** with **14-18** + **9-17**.
    **14** is connected to **18** and **9**.
    So we have **18-14-9-17**.
    This avoids the long **14-17** edge.
    This uses **14-18** (Medium), **14-9** (Medium/Short), **9-17** (Short).
    This is definitely better than **14-17** (Long).
    
    So the path is:
    **18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> (Back to 18)**?
    Check **4 -> 18**.
    **4** is central. **18** is top.
    Distance is Medium.
    Is it better than **19-11**?
    We have **19-11** in the chain.
    Is **4-18** better than **19-18**?
    **19-18** is Short.
    **10-19**? **10-18** is Medium. **10-15** Short.
    Path: **...10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4**.
    Where to close **4**?
    **4** must close to **18**.
    Visually **4** is far from **18**.
    **4** is close to **11** and **9**.
    **11** is close to **19** and **1**.
    **19** is close to **12** and **18**.
    
    Let's try: **... 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14**.
    (We established 14 connects to 9).
    Then **14 -> 17**. (The long edge).
    It seems we are forced to use **14-17** OR **4-18** (or similar cross-center jump).
    **14-17** is on the hull. Hull edges are preferred in TSP.
    **4-18** is an internal chord.
    
    Let's re-evaluate **4-18**.
    **4** is at approx y=300. **18** is at y=50.
    **14** is at y=150. **17** is at y=400.
    Gap 14-17 is ~250.
    Gap 4-18 is ~250.
    They are comparable.
    However, **14-17** keeps the "loop" shape. **4-18** cuts the polygon.
    Also, **14** is an extremal point. It must have degree 2.
    Its neighbors are clearly **9** and **18**.
    If we use **14-9** and **14-18**, we are forced to enter at 18 and exit at 9 (or vice versa).
    So segment: **18-14-9**.
    Then **9** connects to **17** or **4**.
    If **9-17**: **...18-14-9-17-16...** (down left side).
    If **9-4**: **...18-14-9-4-11...** (down center).
    
    Scenario A: **18-14-9-17...**
    Goes down left: **17-16-20-3-5-6-2-1-8-13**.
    Goes up right: **13-12-7-15-10-19-11-4**.
    Ends at **4**. Starts at **18**.
    Close **4-18**.
    
    Scenario B: **18-14-9-4...**
    Goes down center: **4-11-19-12-7-15-10...**
    This gets stuck at **10**.
    Or **4-11-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17**.
    Ends at **17**. Starts at **18**.
    Close **17-18**. (Very Long).
    
    Scenario A is the winner. **4-18** is the closing edge.
    Is there a better closing edge?
    How about **19-11** is used?
    **11** is close to **4** and **19**.
    **4** is close to **9** and **11**.
    **19** is close to **12** and **11**.
    So **12-19-11-4-9** is a chain.
    If we use this chain, we connect right (**12**) to left (**9**).
    Chain: **13-12-19-11-4-9-14-18-10-15-7**.
    Ends at **7**. Starts at **13**.
    Close **7-13**? No.
    Wait, **7** is near **12**. **12** is used.
    Swap top right: **13-12-7-15-10-18-19-11-4-9-14**.
    Ends at **14**. Starts at **13**.
    Close **14-13**? No.
    This assumes **9-14**.
    But **14** must connect to **17** to go down?
    No, **9** connects to **17**.
    So **14-9-17**.
    This makes **14** a dead end unless **14-18**.
    So **18-14-9-17...**
    This brings us back to **Scenario A**.
    
    The loop is **18-14-9-17-16-20-3-5-6-2-1-8-13-12-7-15-10-19-11-4-18**.
    Is **4-18** real?
    Or maybe **4** connects to **19**?
    **...10-15-7-12-19-4-11...**?
    Distance 19-4 is > Distance 19-11.
    Distance 11-4 is Short.
    Distance 4-18 is Long.
    Maybe **11-18**? Long.
    Maybe **19-18**? Short.
    So we want **19-18**.
    Loop: **...10-15-7-12-13-8-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9-14-18-19-11-4**.
    Ends at **4**. Starts at **10** (or whatever).
    We need to close **4** to the start.
    If start is **10**, **4-10** is long.
    What connects to **4**? **9** and **11**.
    What connects to **11**? **19** and **1**.
    What connects to **1**? **2** and **11**.
    
    Okay, I see the cluster **4, 11, 19**.
    And **1, 2** is below.
    And **9** is left.
    **9-4-11-19-18** is a valid chain.
    (9 to 4 short, 4 to 11 short, 11 to 19 short/med, 19 to 18 short).
    Let's check **11-19**.
    11 is (398, 303). 19 is (476, 178).
    Dist ~147.
    **4-18** was ~250.
    **11-19** is much better.
    So the path goes through **11-19**.
    
    Revised Path:
    **14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 14**.
    Let's check the closures.
    **14-9**: OK.
    **9-4**: OK.
    **4-11**: OK.
    **11-19**: OK.
    **19-18**: OK.
    **18-10**: OK.
    **10-15**: OK.
    **15-7**: OK.
    **7-12**: OK.
    **12-13**: Long.
    **13-8**: OK.
    **8-1**: OK.
    **1-2**: OK.
    **2-6**: OK.
    **6-5**: OK.
    **5-3**: OK.
    **3-20**: OK.
    **20-16**: OK.
    **16-17**: OK.
    **17-14**: Long.
    
    We have two long edges: **12-13** and **17-14**.
    Can we remove **17-14**?
    We need to connect **17** to **9**?
    **16-17-9**.
    Then **9** connects to **14** or **4**.
    If **9-14**: **...16-17-9-14-18...**
    This uses **14-18** (Medium) instead of **14-17** (Long).
    This sequence **9-14-18** breaks the **9-4-11-19-18** chain.
    If we break **9-4**, we need to connect **4** elsewhere.
    **4-11**.
    **11-1**.
    **1-2...**
    So **...17-9-14-18-19-12-7-15-10...**?
    Wait, **18-19** is good.
    **19-11**.
    **11-4**.
    **4-1**. (We established 4-1 is worse than 4-11, but 11 is taken. 4-1 is ~200. 1-11 is ~160. 1-2 is ~30).
    So **4** connects to **1**?
    Or **4** connects to **11** and **11** connects to **1**.
    Chain: **19-11-4**? No. **4** is dead end.
    Chain: **4-11-1**.
    So path: **...14-18-10-15-7-12-19-11-4**.
    From **4**, go to **9**? **4-9** is short.
    From **9**, go to **17**? **9-17** is short.
    From **17**, go to **16-20-3-5-6-2-1**.
    From **1**, go to **8**.
    From **8**, go to **13**.
    From **13**, go to **12**?
    Loop: **12-13-8-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9-4-11-19-18-14-10? No. 18-10**.
    Where does **10** go? **10-15-7-12**.
    Wait, **18-10-15-7-12** works.
    Are all nodes covered?
    **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20**.
    Edges:
    - 12-13: Long.
    - 13-8: Good.
    - 8-1: Good. (Or 8-2, 2-1). Let's check 1-2-6-5-3. 1 is close to 2. 8 is close to 2.
      - **13-8-2-1**? Then **1-6** (bad).
      - **13-8-1-2**? Then **2-6** (good).
      - So **13-8-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9-4-11**.
      - **11-19**.
      - **19-18**.
      - **18-14**.
      - **14-10**? **BAD**. **14-10** is long.
      - Swap **14, 18**.
      - **...19-11-4-9-17-16...**
      - This requires **9** to connect to **17** and **4**.
      - Then **14** is separate. **14** connects to **18**. And **9**?
      - If **9** connects to **14**, we break the **9-4** link.
      - We need **14** to have 2 neighbors. **9** and **18**.
      - So sequence **18-14-9**.
      - **9** connects to **4**.
      - **4** connects to **11**.
      - **11** connects to **1**.
      - **1** connects to **2**.
      - **2** connects to **6**.
      - **6** connects to **5**.
      - **5** connects to **3**.
      - **3** connects to **20**.
      - **20** connects to **16**.
      - **16** connects to **17**.
      - **17** connects to **?**
      - We are at **17**.
      - Remaining: **19, 12, 13, 7, 15, 10**.
      - **18** connects to **19**.
      - **19** connects to **12**.
      - **12** connects to **7**.
      - **7** connects to **15**.
      - **15** connects to **10**.
      - **10** connects to **?**
      - **10** connects to **18**. (We started at 18).
      - So we have two chains.
      - Chain 1: **18-14-9-4-11-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17**.
      - Chain 2: **18-19-12-7-15-10**.
      - End of Chain 1 is **17**. End of Chain 2 is **10**.
      - We need to connect them. **17-10** is terrible.
      - We need to connect the ends of the chains to **13, 8**.
      - **17** connects to **?** (nothing good nearby except 9, 16).
      - Maybe **17** connects to **13**? No.
      - Maybe **16-17-9-14-18-19-11-4-1-2-6-5-3-20**.
      - This creates a small loop on the left.
      
    Let's go back to the most promising loop **14-17** vs **12-13** vs **4-18**.
    The loop **14-9-17-16-20-3-5-6-2-1-8-13-12-7-15-10-18-19-11-4-14**.
    Edges: **14-9**, **9-17**, **13-12**, **4-14**.
    **4-14** is the only one I am unsure of.
    **4-14** is definitely worse than **18-14**.
    So we swap **4-14** for **18-14**.
    Sequence: **14-18-19-11-4-9-17...**
    This means **19-18** (Short), **18-14** (Medium), **14-9** (Medium).
    Leaves **10-15-7-12**.
    Connect **19** to **10**?
    **18-10** is better.
    So **14-18-10-15-7-12-19-11-4-9-17**.
    This leaves **12-19** (Good), **19-11** (Good), **11-4** (Good), **4-9** (Good), **9-17** (Good).
    And the rest follows the perimeter.
    The only "jump" is **12-13**.
    **12-7-15-10-18-14** ... **17-16...** ... **8-13**.
    So connect **13** to **12**.
    This forms the complete loop.

    Final Path Verification:
    **14, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 19, 11, 4, 9, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13**.
    Then **13 -> 14**? No.
    **13 -> 12**.
    Loop is closed via **12-13**?
    No, 12 is in the middle of the list.
    My list: 14 -> ... -> 12 -> 19 -> ... -> 13.
    This implies **13 -> 14**.
    This is incorrect.
    
    Correct topology:
    **13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19**... No **19** connects to **12**.
    We need **19** to be adjacent to **11** and **12**.
    So: **... 11 -> 19 -> 12 -> 13 ...**
    Path:
    **1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17, 9, 4, 11, 19, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 14**.
    Now close **14 -> 1**.
    **14** is top left. **1** is bottom right-ish.
    This is impossible.
    
    The endpoints of the "C" must be close.
    The gap is **12-13**.
    The gap is **14-17**.
    
    Let's assume the path does NOT cross the **14-17** gap.
    So **14** connects to **9**.
    **17** connects to **9**.
    So **14-9-17**.
    This is a sharp V-shape.
    This works.
    
    Now the gap **12-13**.
    **12** connects to **7, 19**.
    **13** connects to **8**.
    If we don't cross **12-13**, then **13** is a dead end?
    **13** must connect to **12** or loop all the way around?
    It must connect to **12**.
    
    So the loop contains **13-12**.
    And it contains **14-9-17**.
    And it contains **19-11-4**? Or **19-12**?
    If **12-13**, then **12** also connects to **7** or **19**.
    If **12-19**, then **19-11...**.
    Then **7** connects to **15**.
    **15-10-18-14**.
    So path segment: **... 13-12-19-11-4-9-17-16-20-3-5-6-2-1-8 ...**
    This leaves **7, 15, 10, 18, 14**.
    Connect **14** to **9**.
    Connect **18** to **14**.
    Connect **10** to **18**.
    Connect **15** to **10**.
    Connect **7** to **15**.
    Connect **?** to **7**.
    In the segment above, **12** is connected to **13** and **19**.
    So **7** is stranded.
    **12** needs to connect to **13** and **7**.
    So **19** must connect to something else.
    **19** connects to **18**? Yes.
    
    Correct Chain:
    **13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8**.
    Close **8 -> 13**.
    Check **14-17** (Long).
    Check **19-18** (Good).
    Check **19-11** (Good).
    
    Alternative for **14-17**:
    **13 -> 12 -> 7 -> 15 -> 10 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 9 -> 17 -> 16 -> 20 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8**.
    We missed **14, 18**.
    Insert **14, 18** near **10**.
    **10 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9**.
    So: **... 10 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12 ...**
    Wait, **19** connects to **12**.
    What does **10** connect to? **15** and **18**.
    So: **... 15 -> 10 -> 18 -> 14 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 12 -> 13 ...**
    Does **9** connect to **17**? No, we went **9 -> 4**.
    Where does **17** connect?
    **17** connects to **16** and **?**.
    We need to connect **17** to the rest.
    Visually **17** connects to **9**.
    But **9** is used (14-9-4).
    Can **9** be a hub? No.
    So **17** connects to **9**.
    Then **9** connects to **4** or **14**.
    If **9-14**, then **14-18**.
    Then **4** is stranded? No, **4** connects to **11**.
    And **11** connects to **19**.
    And **19** connects to **12**.
    What connects to **4**?
    **1?**
    Chain: **1-11-4**.
    So **... 1-11-4-9-17 ...**?
    This breaks **14**.
    **9** connects to **14** and **17**.
    So **17-9-14**.
    Then **14-18**.
    Then **18-10**.
    Then **10-15-7-12-19-11-4**.
    Ends at **4**.
    Starts at **16** (from 17).
    Bottom loop: **4 -> ?**
    **4 -> 1**.
    **1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16**.
    This closes the loop!
    **4-1** is the bridge. Distance ~200.
    **12-13** is the other bridge.
    Path:
    **14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14**.
    Wait, where is **19, 11, 4, 1**?
    Insert: **12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 1 -> 8**. (Instead of 12-13-8).
    Then **13** is stranded.
    **8 -> 13 -> ?**
    **13 -> 12**?
    So **... 7 -> 12 -> 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18 -> 14**.
    Close **14-10**? No.
    **18-10** is used? No.
    **10-15-7**.
    So **... 18-19-11-4-9-14**.
    Then **14-17**? (Long).
    
    Okay, I will stick with the most reliable "visual hull" + "logical insertion" result which includes **14-17** and **12-13**.
    1.  **14**
    2.  **17**
    3.  **16**
    4.  **20**
    5.  **3**
    6.  **5**
    7.  **6**
    8.  **2**
    9.  **1**
    10. **8**
    11. **13**
    12. **12**
    13. **7**
    14. **15**
    15. **10**
    16. **18**
    17. **19**
    18. **11**
    19. **4**
    20. **9**
    (And 9 connects back to 14).

    Let's check 9-14. Good.
    Let's check 4-9. Good.
    Let's check 11-4. Good.
    Let's check 19-11. Good.
    Let's check 18-19. Good.
    Let's check 1-8. Good.
    Let's check 14-17. Long but necessary to close.

    One final tweak:
    **1-11** instead of **1-8**?
    If **1-11**, then **8** must connect to **2** and **13**.
    **13-8-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9-14-18-10-15-7-12-19-11-1**.
    Now connect **1** to **4**? Or **1** to **9**?
    **1** is near **4**.
    **4-1**.
    Then **4-9**.
    Then **9-17**.
    This replaces **14-17** with **4-1** and **9-14**.
    **4-1** is ~200. **14-17** is ~250.
    This seems better.
    Let's trace:
    **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 20 -> 16 -> 17 -> 9 -> 14 -> 18 -> 10 -> 15 -> 7 -> 12 -> 19 -> 11 -> 4 -> 1**.
    Close **1 -> 13**? No.
    Close **1 -> 8**? No, 8 used.
    Wait, **1** is next to **2**.
    So **1** is basically at the bottom.
    **4** is the dangling end.
    **4** connects to **1**?
    And **1** connects to **2**.
    So sequence **4-1-2-8-13**.
    And **13-12**.
    And **12-19**.
    And **19-11**.
    And **11** connects to **4**? (Loop 4-1-2...19-11-4).
    Where is the rest? **9-17...**
    **11** connects to **?**.
    We need to leave the **4-11-19** cluster.
    **4 -> 9**.
    So **... 1-11-19-12-13-8-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-14-18-10-15-7**.
    Ends at **7**. Starts at **1**.
    Connect **7** to **12**? Used.
    Connect **7** to **19**? Used.
    Connect **7** to **?**
    We are stuck.

    I will provide the **14-17** loop as it is robust.
    List: 14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9.

    Wait, re-looking at **4-1**.
    **1** is (386, 461). **4** is (337, 266).
    **1** is (386, 461). **11** is (398, 303).
    **1-11** is much shorter than **1-4**.
    So **1-11** is the preferred edge.
    If **1-11**, then **11-4-9-14-18-10-15-7-12-19**.
    Ends at 19. Starts at 1.
    **1** connects to **2**.
    **2-6-5-3-20-16-17**.
    Ends at 17.
    Connect **17-19**? No.
    Connect **17** to **9**? Used.
    Connect **17** to **14**? Used.
    Connect **17** to **16**? Used.
    This path is broken.

    Final Decision:
    Path following the perimeter counter-clockwise from 14.
    14, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17.
    Close 17-14.
    This seems the most consistent.

    Let's refine the numbers 1, 2, 8.
    8 -> 1 -> 2? 8 is right of 1/2. 1 is above 2.
    8 -> 2 -> 1?
    2 -> 1 -> 11?
    In my path: 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6.
    This works well.

    Final list: 14, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17.

    Let me reconsider the 14-17 closing.
    Is **17-9-14** better?
    List: 17, 9, 14, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16.
    Close 16-17.
    Where are 4, 11, 19?
    Insert: **9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 19 -> 18**.
    So: 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9, 14.
    Close **14-17**.
    This creates the same loop.
    The order is just shifted.

    I will output the list starting from 14.
    14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9

    Actually, looking at **9-4-11-19-18**, **19-11** is better than **19-12**.
    But **12** must connect to **13** and **7**.
    So **19** connects to **18** and **11**.
    This is consistent.

    Correct Order:
    14, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17

    Wait, **1-2-6** vs **1-6**.
    **1** is close to **2** and **8**.
    **2** is close to **1** and **6**.
    **8** is close to **1** and **13**.
    **13-8-1-2-6** is optimal.

    Final check:
    14 -> 9
    9 -> 4
    4 -> 11
    11 -> 19
    19 -> 18
    18 -> 10
    10 -> 15
    15 -> 7
    7 -> 12
    12 -> 13
    13 -> 8
    8 -> 1
    1 -> 2
    2 -> 6
    6 -> 5
    5 -> 3
    3 -> 20
    20 -> 16
    16 -> 17
    17 -> 14

    This seems to be the best possible visual solution.

    14, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17

    Wait, **14-9** is good.
    **17-14** is the long one.
    Is there any way to avoid it?
    **17-9-14-18...**
    Then close **18** to what?
    **18-19**.
    **19-11**.
    **11-4**.
    **4-1**. (This is the jump ~200).
    **1-2**.
    **2-6...**
    **...16-17**.
    Close **17-9**.
    This path has jump **4-1**.
    My previous path had jump **17-14**.
    Gap 17-14 is ~250.
    Gap 4-1 is ~200.
    So **4-1** might be better.
    Let's write that sequence:
    14, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17, 9, 4, 11, 19.
    Wait, **19-14**? No.
    **19** must connect to **11** and **18**.
    So **...18-19-11...**
    **14-18-19-11-4-1-2-6-5-3-20-16-17-9**.
    Close **9-14**.
    This has **4-1** (~200) and **11-4** (Short) and **9-14** (Med) and **17-9** (Short).
    This avoids **17-14** (Long).
    And avoids **12-13**? No, **12-13** is mandatory.
    So: **14, 18, 19, 11, 4, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17, 9**.
    Where is the right side? **13, 12, 7, 15, 10**.
    Insert at **1**: **1-8-13-12-7-15-10**.
    Then connect **10-18**? (Already used 18).
    Connect **10-14**? No.
    Connect **10-19**? No.
    This topology is tricky.
    
    I'll stick to the perimeter loop. It's the standard human strategy and usually correct for these types of "connect the dots" visual puzzles.
    The order **14, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17** is my final answer.

    Wait, I missed **1** in the 8-2 chain.
    **8-1-2-6**.
    1 is between 8 and 2? No, 1 is above 2.
    Visually 8-1-2-6 creates a crossing of 8-2 and 1-?.
    Let's look at cluster 1, 2, 8.
    Coords: 1(386,461), 2(395,491), 8(410,480).
    Distance 1-2: ~31.
    Distance 2-8: ~18.
    Distance 1-8: ~30.
    Triangle.
    Incoming from 13. **13-8**.
    Outgoing to 6. **2-6**.
    So we need to traverse 8, 1, 2.
    **13-8-1-2-6**.
    Or **13-8-2-1**? Then 1 to 11? Or 1 to 6?
    1 to 6 is long.
    So **1** must be internal.
    **13-8-2-1** is a dead end for 1.
    Unless **1-11**.
    If **1-11** is used, we are back to the **4-1** jump hypothesis.
    If we stick to perimeter, we must do **13-8-1-2-6**.
    This crosses itself?
    13 is right. 6 is left.
    8 is right-bottom.
    1 is top of cluster.
    2 is bottom of cluster.
    **8-1** goes up-left. **1-2** goes down-right. **2-6** goes left.
    This is fine.

    So list: 14, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 10, 15, 7, 12, 13, 8, 1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 20, 16, 17

    Wait, 17 connects back to 14.
    Start: 14.
    14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9.
    (9 connects to 14).
    This matches all visual constraints.

    Corrected list order to start with 1 (as example uses 1):
    (Just to be safe, I will start with 14 as I derived it).
    
    14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9

    Double check 9 vs 17 vs 14.
    If 14-17-16-20-3-5-6-2-1-8-13-12-7-15-10-18-19-11-4-9.
    Then 9-14.
    This works.
    
    One final check on **1, 2, 8**.
    If we do **8-1-2-6**, dist(8,1) + dist(1,2) + dist(2,6).
    If we do **8-2-1-6**, dist(8,2) + dist(2,1) + dist(1,6).
    Dist(1,6) is > Dist(2,6).
    So **8-1-2-6** is better.
    
    The list is solid.

    14, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 13, 12, 7, 15, 10, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9
