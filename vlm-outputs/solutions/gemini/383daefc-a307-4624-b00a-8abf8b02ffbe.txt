Based on the visual layout of the points, the optimal (shortest) tour connects neighboring points to form a single loop without crossing itself.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Start at the bottom-left cluster: **13, 1, 4**
2.  Move right to the bottom-right cluster: **7, 11**
3.  Move up to the next point on the right edge: **6**
4.  Continue upwards: **14**
5.  Move up towards the top-right: **2, 9**
6.  Go to the furthest top-right point: **5**
7.  Now sweep back across to the far left point: **8**
8.  Go down to the left-side cluster: **10, 3, 12, 15**
9.  This leads back towards point 13 to close the loop.

**Shortest Tour:**
13, 1, 4, 7, 11, 6, 14, 2, 9, 5, 8, 10, 3, 12, 15
