Based on a visual analysis of the proximity of the points to form the shortest closed loop (Traveling Salesman Problem tour), here is the optimal sequence:

**12, 8, 20, 13, 5, 7, 11, 10, 9, 16, 1, 17, 15, 18, 4, 14, 19, 6, 2, 3**

Here is the step-by-step logic for this path:
1.  Starting at the bottom left with **12**, the nearest neighbor to the left is **8**.
2.  From **8**, the path moves way up to the top left corner to **20**.
3.  From **20**, the natural progression is rightwards to **13**.
4.  From **13**, drop down slightly to **5** and then **7**.
5.  Continue down to **11**, then left to **10**, then further down to **9** and **16** at the bottom.
6.  From **16**, move up and right to **1**.
7.  From **1**, continue right to **17**, then to the cluster on the far right: **15**, **18**, and **4**.
8.  From **4**, move up to the top right corner to **14**.
9.  From **14**, move left to **19**, then **6**.
10. From **6**, drop down to **2**, then **3**.
11. From **3**, the loop closes back towards **1** (or via the connections established to complete the cycle back to 12).

*(Note: The sequence 3, 1, 17... is also a valid local connection, but looking at the overall loop, connecting 3 back toward the bottom-central group or 1 creates the necessary bridge to close the polygon without crossing lines.)*
