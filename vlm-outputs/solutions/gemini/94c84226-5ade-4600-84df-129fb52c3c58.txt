Based on a visual analysis of the points to find the shortest path connecting all of them in a cycle, here is the optimal tour. The points form a somewhat loose "C" or crescent shape with some outliers.

Here is the most logical sequence following the points' proximity to each other:

1.  Start at the bottom left with **14**.
2.  Move up to the nearby pair **9** and then **6**.
3.  Continue generally upwards/rightwards to **12**.
4.  Then to **13**.
5.  Up to the top cluster: **5**, then **3**.
6.  Move right to **4**.
7.  Descend slightly to **11**.
8.  Then to **1**, and **10**.
9.  Continue down the right side to **7** and **2**.
10. Go to the furthest bottom-right point, **15**.
11. Finally, cut back across the bottom to point **8** and return to **14** (implicit) to close the loop.

Ordering:
**14, 9, 6, 12, 13, 5, 3, 4, 11, 1, 10, 7, 2, 15, 8**

(Note: The sequence can also be reversed, or started from any other point, but the cyclic order remains the same.)
