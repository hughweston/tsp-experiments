To determine the shortest tour, I will visually analyze the proximity of the points to trace the most efficient path that forms a loop without crossing itself.

1.  **Identify Points and Clusters:**
    *   Left side (top to bottom): 4, 1, 10, 6, 8.
    *   Bottom/Center: 5.
    *   Bottom Right: 7, 2.
    *   Top Right: 3, 9.

2.  **Trace the Path:**
    *   Let's start at the top left with point **4**.
    *   The nearest neighbor is clearly point **1** just below it.
    *   From 1, the next logical step down is to **10**.
    *   From 10, moving down and slightly left takes us to **6**.
    *   From 6, point **8** is very close.
    *   From 8, we need to move towards the rest of the points. The closest one is point **5** in the lower center.
    *   From 5, looking right, the next closest points are in the bottom right corner. We head towards **7**.
    *   From 7, the natural continuation is to point **2**, the furthest bottom-right point.
    *   Now we need to loop back up towards the top. From 2, it's a long jump, but the next unvisited cluster is at the top right. We go to point **3**.
    *   From 3, point **9** is right next to it.
    *   Finally, to close the loop, from 9 we would go back to our starting point 4 (across the top). This completes the cycle.

3.  **Verify the Order:**
    *   Let's check the sequence: 4 -> 1 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 9 -> (back to 4).
    *   Is there a shorter way? For example, from 2 to 7 to 5? No, 7 is "on the way" to 2. From 8 to 5 is the bridge between the left cluster and the right cluster. The jump from 2 to 3 (or 7 to 3) is unavoidable to connect the bottom right to the top right. The jump from 9 to 4 connects the top right back to top left.
    *   Let's consider reversing the right side: 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 3... That would imply crossing lines or longer distances. The sequence 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 makes a nice convex hull shape.
    *   The path essentially traces the convex hull or perimeter of the points, dipping in only when points are collinear or clustered, which is the standard strategy for Euclidean TSP.

4.  **Final Sequence:**
    4, 1, 10, 6, 8, 5, 7, 2, 3, 9

    (Or any cyclic permutation or reverse of this list, e.g., 9, 3, 2, 7, 5, 8, 6, 10, 1, 4). I will provide the one starting with 4 as derived.

**Answer:**
4, 1, 10, 6, 8, 5, 7, 2, 3, 9
