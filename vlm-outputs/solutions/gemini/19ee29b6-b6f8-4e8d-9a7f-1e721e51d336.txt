Based on the visual layout of the points, the shortest tour follows the outer boundary of the points and connects nearest neighbors to form a single loop.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Starting at the bottom left with **19**, the nearest point moving upwards is **7**.
2.  Continue along that line to **4**.
3.  The next closest point upwards and to the left is **10**.
4.  From 10, move towards the central cluster, hitting **22** next.
5.  Then go down slightly to **16**.
6.  Move back up towards the top arc: first to **17**, then **2**, then **5**.
7.  Continue the arc to the far right, reaching **6**.
8.  Move down the right edge to **11**.
9.  Continue down to **8**.
10. Continue down to **15**.
11. Continue to the nearby **3**.
12. Move inwards/leftwards to **14**.
13. Then to **18**.
14. Go down to the bottom right cluster: **9**, then **13**.
15. Move leftwards along the bottom section to **20**.
16. Move up slightly to **12**.
17. Continue left to **21**.
18. Continue left to **23**.
19. Continue left/down to **24**.
20. Move down to the bottom area to **25**.
21. Finally, go to **1**, which leads back towards the start area (19).
