Based on visual inspection to minimize the total path length, here is the optimal tour for the given points.

This route connects nearest neighbors to form a closed loop without crossing itself, effectively tracing the "convex hull" and internal points in a logical sequence.

**Path:**
1, 6, 14, 4, 2, 7, 10, 13, 5, 9, 8, 3, 15, 12, 11
