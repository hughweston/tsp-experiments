To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I will visually determine the shortest path by connecting nearest neighbors to form a closed loop without crossing lines.

Here is the step-by-step path I have determined:

1.  Starting at the bottom left with point **11**.
2.  Move slightly up and right to **7**.
3.  Continue upwards to **20**.
4.  Further up and left to **16**.
5.  Move right to **21**.
6.  Continue right to **9**.
7.  Go up to the top left area to **23**.
8.  Move right across the top to **15**.
9.  Drop down slightly to **14**.
10. Move right to **3**.
11. Go further right and up to the corner point **17**.
12. Come down the right side to **13**.
13. Continue down to **18**.
14. Move inward (left) to **4**.
15. Drop down and right to **24**.
16. Continue down to **6**.
17. Move down and left to **10**.
18. Continue left to **2**.
19. Move slightly up and left to **8**.
20. Move left to **22**.
21. Drop down to the bottom point **1**.
22. Move up and left to **25**.
23. Move right to **19**.
24. Move up to **12**.
25. Move left to **5**.
    *   *(From 5, the path connects back to 9 or loops through the cluster to get back towards the start, but looking at the global structure, a better flow is 20 -> 16 -> 21 -> 9 -> 5 -> 12 -> 19 -> 25 -> 22 -> 1... Let's refine the bottom-left cluster).*

**Refined Path Logic:**
Let's trace the "outer hull" and fill in the interior points efficiently.

*   Start at **11**.
*   Go to **1** (bottom).
*   Go to **22**.
*   Go to **2**.
*   Go to **10**.
*   Go to **6**.
*   Go to **24**.
*   Go to **18**.
*   Go to **13**.
*   Go to **17**.
*   Go to **3**.
*   Go to **15**.
*   Go to **14**.
*   Go to **23**.
*   Go to **21**.
*   Go to **16**.
*   Go to **20**.
*   Go to **7**.
*   Now handle the interior: From 7, go to **25**.
*   From 25, go to **19**.
*   From 19, go to **8**? No, 8 is closer to 2 and 22. Let's backtrack.

**Let's try a sweep approach (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise):**

1.  **11** (Far left)
2.  **20**
3.  **16**
4.  **21**
5.  **23**
6.  **15**
7.  **14**
8.  **3**
9.  **17**
10. **13**
11. **18**
12. **4** (Interior point near 18)
13. **24**
14. **6**
15. **10**
16. **2**
17. **8**
18. **22**
19. **1**
20. **25** (Interior point)
21. **19**
22. **12**
23. **5**
24. **9**
25. **7**
    *   *(From 7, the path returns to 11 to close the loop. This looks like a very strong candidate for the optimal tour.)*

**Final Path Check:**
11 -> 20 -> 16 -> 21 -> 23 -> 15 -> 14 -> 3 -> 17 -> 13 -> 18 -> 4 -> 24 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 22 -> 1 -> 25 -> 19 -> 12 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> (back to 11).

This path visits every node, has no long cross-country jumps, and follows the visual clusters logically.

**Answer:**
11, 20, 16, 21, 23, 15, 14, 3, 17, 13, 18, 4, 24, 6, 10, 2, 8, 22, 1, 25, 19, 12, 5, 9, 7
