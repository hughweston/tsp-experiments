Based on the visual layout of the points, the optimal shortest path connects nearest neighbors to form a closed loop without crossing itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the path:

1.  **Start at the bottom left cluster:** Let's begin at point **2**.
2.  The closest point to 2 is clearly **1**.
3.  From 1, the path needs to head towards the top left cluster. The jump to **7** or **6** is long, but necessary. Let's go up to **7**.
4.  From 7, the immediate neighbor is **6**.
5.  From 6, we need to cross over to the right side of the image. The most central point to aim for is **9**.
6.  From 9, the path should descend into the bottom right cluster. The closest point is **8**.
7.  From 8, we continue downwards/rightwards to **5**.
8.  From 5, we can go to **3**, which is at the bottom.
9.  From 3, we move up/right to the far edge points, first hitting **10**.
10. From 10, the last unvisited point is **4**.
11. Finally, the loop closes by going from 4 all the way back to the starting region (point 2), but practically, the list ends here as the cycle is implied.

Let's re-verify the bottom right cluster connection: 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9... No, 9 is quite high. A better flow for the right side is likely: ... -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 1 ...

Let's trace that alternative:
- Start at **2**, go to **1**.
- Go from **1** to **8** (this is a long diagonal, but potentially shorter than 1->7). Let's stick to the visual convex hull.
- A "C" shape or circular shape is usually optimal.
- Let's trace the perimeter:
    - **2** (bottom left)
    - **1** (up/right slightly)
    - **8** (far right/middle) -> This jump is quite large.
    - Let's reconsider the 1 -> 7 jump. It looks visually shorter or comparable to crossing the whole empty middle space. The layout has a big gap in the middle. The points are essentially in three groups: {2, 1}, {7, 6}, and {9, 8, 5, 4, 10, 3}.

Let's try to connect the clusters efficiently:
- Cluster A: {2, 1}
- Cluster B: {7, 6}
- Cluster C: {9, 8, 5, 4, 10, 3}

The shortest path between Cluster A and B is 1-7.
The shortest path between Cluster B and C is 6-9.
The shortest path between Cluster C and A is likely 8-1 or 5-1.

Let's trace inside Cluster C:
9 is at the top. 8 is below it. Then 5. Then 3 is bottom. 10 is far right. 4 is above 10.
A logical path through this dense cluster would be: 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8.
Or: 9 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4.

Let's combine these segments:
**2 -> 7** (long jump) -> **6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2**.
Looking at the distances:
- 1 to 7 is closer than 2 to 7. So ...2 -> 1 -> 7... makes sense.
- 6 to 9 is the bridge.
- Inside the right group: 9 is top. 4 is right-mid. 10 is bottom-right. 3 is bottom-center. 5 is mid-center. 8 is mid-left.
- Sequence: 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8. From 8, we jump back to 1.
- Let's check 8 to 1. 8 is the leftmost point of the right cluster. 1 is the rightmost point of the left cluster. This is the shortest bridge across the bottom gap.

So the full tour loop looks like:
**1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 1**... wait, where is 2?
2 is attached to 1. The tail.
So: **2 -> 1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> (back to 1/2)**. Wait, the loop must close.
From 8, the closest point is 1. But we started at 2. So the return trip 8->2 is longer than 8->1.
The standard TSP on this configuration is usually a loop around the periphery.

Let's trace the perimeter:
- Start **2**.
- Go to **7**? No, too far.
- Go to **1**.
- From **1**, jump to **8**. (Crossing the bottom gap).
- From **8**, go to **5**.
- From **5**, go to **3**.
- From **3**, go to **10**.
- From **10**, go to **4**.
- From **4**, go to **9**.
- From **9**, jump across the top gap to **6**.
- From **6**, go to **7**.
- From **7**, jump down to **2**.

Let's compare the "top bridge" vs "bottom bridge".
Bridge 1: 1 -> 7 (Left side vertical).
Bridge 2: 6 -> 9 (Top horizontal).
Bridge 3: 8 -> 1 (Bottom horizontal).

The loop **2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2**
- 2->7 is a very long diagonal.
- 1->2 is short.
- 1->8 is a medium jump.
- 6->9 is a medium jump.
- 7->6 is short.

Let's look at **2 -> 1 -> 7**...
1 is clearly closer to 7 than 2 is. So the order 2-1-7 is better than 1-2-7.
The path would be:
Start **2 -> 1**.
Next closest cluster is top-left {7,6}. The closest point to 1 is 7.
So **1 -> 7**.
Then **7 -> 6**.
From 6, go to the big group on the right. Closest is **9**.
So **6 -> 9**.
Now traverse the right group downwards.
**9 -> 4** (closest to 9 other than 8, but 8 is needed to return to 1? No, we need to visit all).
Let's look at the shape of the right cluster. It's a ring: 9-4-10-3-5-8-9.
We entered at 9. We need to exit at a point close to the start (which was 2/1). The point closest to the start {2,1} is **8**.
So we should traverse the right cluster starting at 9 and ending at 8.
Path: **9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8**.
Finally, close the loop: **8 -> 2**. (This is the long "closing" edge). Or is it **8 -> 1**?
If we started 2->1->7... then we end at 8, and the edge is 8->2.
Let's check if we can improve the closing edge.
Maybe we end at 5? No, 8 is further left.
Maybe the sequence in the first cluster is 1->2?
Path: **1 -> 2 -> 7** (2 is further from 7, bad idea).

What if we go clockwise/counter-clockwise differently?
Let's try to close the gap between 1 and 8 first.
**2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 2**.
- 2 -> 1 (short)
- 1 -> 8 (medium, crosses the gap)
- 8 -> 5 (short)
- 5 -> 3 (short)
- 3 -> 10 (short)
- 10 -> 4 (short)
- 4 -> 9 (short)
- 9 -> 6 (medium, crosses top gap)
- 6 -> 7 (short)
- 7 -> 2 (Long diagonal). This is the weak link. 7 to 2 is very far.

Let's compare with the previous loop:
**2 -> 1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 2**.
Here the closing link is 8 -> 2. The distance between 8 and 2 is definitely shorter than 7 and 2. Point 8 is much lower down the Y-axis, closer to 2's Y-level.
However, 8 -> 1 is shorter than 8 -> 2.
Is there a way to use 8->1?
Yes, if the sequence is ...->8->1->2->7...
Let's check the link 2->7. That is long.
We seem to be stuck with one long link because the three clusters form a triangle. We have to jump 1-7 (vertical left), 6-9 (horizontal top), and 8-1 (horizontal bottom).
Wait, 7 is high, 6 is high. 9 is high.
1 is low, 2 is low. 8 is low-mid.
The optimal tour usually doesn't cross itself.
Let's trace the "outer boundary" (convex hullish).
Points: 2, 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7.
Order: **2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 3**? No, 5 is in between. **2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 2**.
The link 7->2 is the problem. It crosses the whole left side.
Is it possible to go **2 -> 7**? No, 1 is in the way.
The only way to visit the "spur" at 2 is to go 1-2-1 (forbidden) or to include it in a loop like X-2-1-Y.
X could be 7. Y could be 8.
Path: **7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8**.
Distance 7->2 is huge. Distance 1->8 is medium.
Path: **7 -> 1 -> 2 -> ?** From 2 you have to go somewhere. If you go to 8, that's a huge diagonal 2->8.
Actually, visually, 1 is between 2 and 7. And 1 is between 2 and 8.
This suggests 2 is a "dead end" visually, but it's not. 2 is just the furthest bottom-left.
So any path involving 2 must connect to 1. The other connection must be to something else. The next closest thing to 2 is likely 7 (very far) or 8 (very far).
Actually, looking closely at the image, 2 is very close to 1.
This suggests the sequence is almost certainly ... -> X -> 1 -> 2 -> Y -> ... or ... -> X -> 2 -> 1 -> Y -> ...
If Y is 7, then 1->7 is better than 2->7. So ... -> 2 -> 1 -> 7 -> ... is preferable.
If Y is 8, then 1->8 is better than 2->8. So ... -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> ... is preferable.
Since 1 is closer to the rest of the graph than 2 is, 2 should be connected to 1 and then "jump" to close the loop from the other side.
Wait, that's not how loops work. In a loop, 2 connects to two neighbors. One is obviously 1. Who is the other?
The candidates for 2's second neighbor are 7 and 8 (or maybe 3).
Visually, 7 is very far up. 8 is to the right.
Let's look at the distance 2 -> 7 vs 2 -> 8 vs 2 -> 3.
2 is at the bottom left. 7 is top left. 8 is mid-right.
Actually, looking at the scaling:
Distance(1, 7) looks to be ~400px.
Distance(1, 8) looks to be ~400px.
Distance(2, 7) looks to be ~450px.
Distance(2, 8) looks to be ~500px.
The loop **7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7**
Segments:
- 7-6 (short)
- 6-9 (med)
- 9-4 (med/short)
- 4-10 (short)
- 10-3 (short)
- 3-5 (short)
- 5-8 (short)
- 8-1 (med)
- 1-2 (short)
- 2-7 (LONG).

Can we avoid the 2-7 long jump?
What if we go **1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1**?
This implies the path segments are: 8->2 and 2->1.
Distance 8->2 is extremely long. It crosses the whole bottom gap, plus goes further left than 1.
Distance 1->7 is shorter than 2->7.
Distance 8->1 is shorter than 8->2.
So having 2 sandwiched between 1 and 8 (1-2-8) is bad because 2 is further out.
Having 2 sandwiched between 1 and 7 (1-2-7) is bad because 2 is further out.
Therefore, 2 must be an endpoint of the "left cluster traversal".
This means the path must look like ... -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...
Let's evaluate this specific link: **2 -> 7**.
Is there any other way?
Maybe the path isn't a simple circle.
What about **7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> (long jump to 1 or 2?)**
If we go 9 -> 8, then 5... we end up at 4 or 10 on the far right.
Then we have to jump back to 1 or 2. That's a huge jump across the screen width.
The current best candidate loop seems to rely on the triangle of clusters.
Edges: (Cluster Left) <-> (Cluster Right) <-> (Cluster Top) <-> (Cluster Left)
Left: {1, 2}
Top: {7, 6}
Right: {9, 8, 5, 4, 10, 3}

Connections:
Left <-> Top: The best link is 1-7. (Distance ~X)
Top <-> Right: The best link is 6-9. (Distance ~Y)
Right <-> Left: The best link is 8-1. (Distance ~Z)

If we use these three bridges:
Path: ... -> 1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> [traverse right cluster] -> 8 -> 1 ...
This leaves point 2 isolated. We must insert 2 into this loop.
Where does 2 fit best?
Insertion cost = dist(A, 2) + dist(2, B) - dist(A, B).
We want to insert 2 between neighbors A and B such that the extra distance is minimized.
Since 2 is a "leaf" sticking out of 1, the best place to insert it is next to 1.
So either between (8, 1) or between (1, 7).
Option A: ... -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 7 -> ...
Cost = dist(8, 2) + dist(2, 1) - dist(8, 1).
Since 2 is "behind" 1 relative to 8, dist(8, 2) is roughly dist(8, 1) + dist(1, 2).
So the added cost is roughly 2 * dist(1, 2). This is a good insertion.
Visually: 8 -> 2 is a straight line passing near 1? No. 1 is slightly above the line 2-8.
Actually, 2 is lower-left of 1. 8 is right of 1. So 2-1-8 is a slightly bent line. 1-2-8 is a V shape.
Going 8->1 is direct. Going 8->2 passes "past" 1. Then 2->1 goes back. This is efficient-ish if 2 is "on the way" but it's not. It's a dead end.
However, compare to Option B: ... -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...
Cost = dist(1, 2) + dist(2, 7) - dist(1, 7).
2 is below 1. 7 is above 1. So 1 is between 2 and 7.
Going 1 -> 7 is a straight line up.
Going 1 -> 2 (down) then 2 -> 7 (all the way up) involves backtracking over the segment 1-2.
The added cost is exactly 2 * dist(1, 2).
So both insertions (next to 8, or next to 7) cost about the same penalty: traveling the 1-2 spur twice.
Wait, TSP doesn't allow visiting 1 twice.
We need a simple cycle.
So we can't do "go to 1, go to 2, go back to 1". That's invalid.
We must go A -> 2 -> 1 -> B or A -> 1 -> 2 -> B.
Let's check A=8, B=7.
Sequence 1: **8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7**.
Distance: dist(8,1) + dist(1,2) + dist(2,7).
Sequence 2: **8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 7**.
Distance: dist(8,2) + dist(2,1) + dist(1,7).
Comparing dist(8,1) + dist(2,7) vs dist(8,2) + dist(1,7).
Visually:
1 is closer to 7 than 2 is. (Advantage Seq 2)
1 is closer to 8 than 2 is. (Advantage Seq 1)
However, 1 is "between" 2 and 7. The path 2->1->7 is almost a straight line.
The path 2->1->8 is a sharp turn (~90-120 degrees).
Geometric intuition: You want to avoid acute angles at intermediate points if possible (usually means detours).
The path segment 7...1...2 is a straight-ish line.
The path segment 8...1...2 is a zig-zag.
So extending the line from 7 down to 1 and continuing to 2 seems more natural.
Then from 2, we have to make the long jump to 8 (or whatever connects on the right).
So: **7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8**.
Let's check the alternative: **7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8**.
Here, 7 -> 2 is very long. Then back to 1. Then to 8. This is crossing lines. 7-2 and 1-8 might not cross, but 7-2 passes right by 1. Since 1 is closer to 7, you are skipping a close point to go to a far point. That's usually suboptimal.
So the sequence at the left cluster is almost certainly **7 -> 1 -> 2 -> [Right Cluster]** or **[Right Cluster] -> 2 -> 1 -> 7**.
Let's assume the latter for counter-clockwise traversal: **8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 7**.
Wait, 8 -> 2 is longer than 8 -> 1. And 1 -> 7 is shorter than 2 -> 7.
Let's look at the angles.
1 is at (x1, y1). 2 is at (x1-dx, y1-dy). 7 is at (x1-small, y1+Big). 8 is at (x1+Big, y1-small).
Vector 1->7 is roughly (0, 1).
Vector 1->2 is roughly (-1, -1).
Vector 1->8 is roughly (1, 0).
Angle 7-1-2 is obtuse (>90).
Angle 2-1-8 is obtuse (>90).
Angle 7-1-8 is approx 90.
If we go 7->1->2->8: The path follows the line 7-1-2 nicely. Then a sharp turn at 2 to go to 8.
If we go 7->2->1->8: 7->2 is long. 2->1 is backtracking. 1->8 is sideways. This is bad.
If we go 8->1->2->7: 8->1 is good. 1->2 is good. 2->7 is backtracking past 1. Bad.
So the "line" 7-1-2 suggests 2 is an endpoint of that segment.
So the connection must be **7 - 1 - 2 - 8**.
This implies the long jump is **2 -> 8**.
Let's check if there's a better connection to 2 from the right cluster.
Maybe **2 -> 5**? 5 is further right.
Maybe **2 -> 3**? 3 is further right.
So **2 -> 8** is the shortest "cross-gap" link starting from 2.
Actually, let's look at **2 -> 10**. No.
So the sequence is roughly:
**Start 2 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2**.
Let's verify this loop.
- 2 -> 8: Long jump across bottom.
- 8 -> 5: Short.
- 5 -> 3: Short.
- 3 -> 10: Short.
- 10 -> 4: Short.
- 4 -> 9: Short/Med.
- 9 -> 6: Med (Bridge).
- 6 -> 7: Short.
- 7 -> 1: Med (Bridge).
- 1 -> 2: Short.
This looks like a very plausible candidate. It traces the perimeter (convex hull) mostly. The only interior-ish segment is 1-2, but 2 is on the hull. 1 is "inside" the hull of 7-2-8? No, 1 is on the segment 7-2. So 7-1-2-8 is the convex hull perimeter.
Wait, if 1 is on the segment 7-2, then 7->1->2 is straight.
So the perimeter is 7->1->2->8...
Is 8 the best target from 2?
Let's check the right cluster internal path.
We arrive at 8. We need to leave at 9 to connect to 6.
So we need a path from 8 to 9 through {5, 3, 10, 4}.
Closest to 8 is 5.
Closest to 5 is 3.
Closest to 3 is 10.
Closest to 10 is 4.
Closest to 4 is 9.
This creates a nice chain: **8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9**.
This chain looks optimal for the right cluster.
So the full loop is:
**2 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2**.

Let's double check if we can go the other way around.
**2 -> 1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 2**.
Same loop, just reversed.
Let's confirm there are no shorter cross-links.
Could we go 6 -> 4? And 9 -> 10? No, 6-9 is the designated bridge.
Could we go 7 -> 9? No, 6 is in between.
Could we go 1 -> 8?
If we used the link 1->8 instead of 2->8.
Then we would need to connect 2 differently.
Path: ... -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 7.
This requires the link 2 -> 7.
Which is shorter?
Link 2 -> 8 vs Link 2 -> 7.
Visually:
2 is bottom-left.
8 is bottom-ish, right.
7 is top-left.
The vertical distance to 7 seems larger than the horizontal distance to 8. But 8 is also slightly up.
Let's use a ruler (on screen).
Let dist(1, 2) be 1 unit.
dist(1, 7) is approx 5 units.
dist(1, 8) is approx 8 units.
This changes things.
If dist(1, 7) < dist(1, 8), then the left cluster {1,2} is "closer" to the top cluster {6,7} than the right cluster {8...}.
Wait, looking again. The gap between 1 and 8 looks WIDE.
The gap between 1 and 7 looks tall but maybe shorter?
Let's measure pixels on the provided image.
Center of 1: (199, 874)
Center of 2: (84, 951)
Center of 7: (133, 213)
Center of 6: (156, 194)
Center of 8: (661, 770)
Center of 9: (719, 477)

Let's calculate Euclidean squared distances:
d(1, 2)^2 = (199-84)^2 + (874-951)^2 = 115^2 + 77^2 = 13225 + 5929 = 19154. (d ≈ 138)
d(1, 7)^2 = (199-133)^2 + (874-213)^2 = 66^2 + 661^2 = 4356 + 436921 = 441277. (d ≈ 664)
d(1, 8)^2 = (199-661)^2 + (874-770)^2 = (-462)^2 + 104^2 = 213444 + 10816 = 224260. (d ≈ 473)
d(2, 7)^2 = (84-133)^2 + (951-213)^2 = (-49)^2 + 738^2 = 2401 + 544644 = 547045. (d ≈ 740)
d(2, 8)^2 = (84-661)^2 + (951-770)^2 = (-577)^2 + 181^2 = 332929 + 32761 = 365690. (d ≈ 604)

Comparisons:
d(1, 8) ≈ 473 is significantly shorter than d(1, 7) ≈ 664.
My visual estimation was wrong. The horizontal gap is smaller than the vertical gap.
This implies 1 is much closer to 8 than to 7.
So we should prioritize the connection **1 <-> 8**.
The connection **1 <-> 7** is the long one.

Okay, let's rebuild the loop with this knowledge.
Main connections:
Left {1,2} should connect to Right {3..10} via the shortest link: **1-8**.
Right {3..10} connects to Top {6,7} via shortest link: **9-6**?
Let's check 9-6 distance.
9: (719, 477). 6: (156, 194).
d(9, 6)^2 = (719-156)^2 + (477-194)^2 = 563^2 + 283^2 = 316969 + 80089 = 397058. (d ≈ 630).
Alternative Top-Right connections:
4: (877, 747). 6: (156, 194). No.
What about Top-Left connection?
We established d(1, 7) ≈ 664.
And d(2, 7) ≈ 740.
So the "triangle of clusters" has sides:
Left-Right: ~473 (Link 1-8)
Right-Top: ~630 (Link 9-6)
Top-Left: ~664 (Link 7-1)

This is a fairly balanced triangle, but 1-8 is the shortest inter-cluster link.
So the path MUST include 1-8 (or 2-8, or 1-5, etc, but 1-8 is best).
Let's verify d(2, 8) ≈ 604. Still worse than 1-8.
So we fix the segment **1-8**.

Now, how to connect the rest?
We are at 1. We must visit 2. Since 2 is a dead end, we must go **8 -> 1 -> 2**.
From 2, we must go to the Top cluster {7,6}.
The link is **2 -> 7**. (d ≈ 740).
Let's check if **2 -> 6** is better?
6: (156, 194). 2: (84, 951). d^2 = (72)^2 + (757)^2 = 5184 + 573049 = 578233. (d ≈ 760). No, 2-7 is better.
So the sequence from Left to Top is **2 -> 7**.
Path so far: ... -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> ...
From 6, we must go to the Right cluster.
Best link is **6 -> 9**. (d ≈ 630).
Path: ... -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> ...
Now we must traverse the Right cluster starting at 9 and ending at 8 (to close the loop).
Right cluster points: {9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8}.
Start at 9. End at 8.
Visually optimal path: **9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8**.
Let's verify this order visually.
9 is top. 4 is mid-right. 10 is bottom-right. 3 is bottom-center. 5 is mid-left(ish). 8 is left.
9->4: Down-right.
4->10: Down-right.
10->3: Left.
3->5: Left-Up.
5->8: Left-Up.
This makes a smooth "C" curve.
What about 9->8 directly? No, we need to end at 8.
What about 9 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 8?
4 to 8 is a cross-over. 5 is in the way.
The convex hull of the right cluster is roughly 9-4-10-3-8-(back to 9). 5 is interior.
If 5 is interior, inserting it is tricky.
Is 5 interior?
8: (661, 770). 3: (819, 988). 5: (756, 856).
Midpoint of 8-3 is ((661+819)/2, (770+988)/2) = (740, 879).
5 is at (756, 856). It is very close to the line segment 8-3.
Let's check d(8, 5) + d(5, 3) vs d(8, 3).
d(8, 5)^2 = (95)^2 + (86)^2 = 9025 + 7396 = 16421. (d ≈ 128).
d(5, 3)^2 = (63)^2 + (132)^2 = 3969 + 17424 = 21393. (d ≈ 146).
Sum = 274.
d(8, 3)^2 = (158)^2 + (218)^2 = 24964 + 47524 = 72488. (d ≈ 269).
274 vs 269. The detour to 5 is TINY.
So 8-5-3 is a very good straight-ish line.
So the sequence ... -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 is excellent.
So the full right cluster traversal **9 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8** works perfectly.

Let's re-evaluate the "Long Jump" 2 -> 7.
Cost of loop A: **1-8-5-3-10-4-9-6-7-2-1** (Note: 1 is visited start and end, sequence is 1->8...->2->1).
Edges: 1-8, ..., 6-9, ..., 2-7, 2-1.
Sum of inter-cluster edges: d(1,8) + d(6,9) + d(2,7).
473 + 630 + 740 = 1843.

Let's look for an alternative loop configuration.
What if we connect **1 -> 7**?
Path: ... -> 8 -> [Right Cluster] -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8.
Wait, 2 -> 8 is the bridge back.
Edges: 1-7, 6-9, 2-8.
Sum: d(1,7) + d(6,9) + d(2,8).
664 + 630 + 604 = 1898.
Comparing 1843 vs 1898.
The first configuration (using 1-8 bridge) is better by ~55 pixels.
Why? Because d(1,8) is much smaller than d(1,7) or d(2,8).
Minimizing the "sum of long jumps" suggests using the shortest available long jump, which is 1-8.
Once we pick 1-8, we are forced into the rest.
If we use edge 1-8, we are at 1 and 8.
At 1, we must go to 2. Edge **1-2**.
At 2, we must leave the cluster. Only option is to Top Cluster. Edge **2-7**.
At 7, we go to 6. Edge **7-6**.
At 6, we bridge to Right Cluster. Edge **6-9**.
At 9, we traverse to 8. Path **9-4-10-3-5-8**.
Then close 8-1.
This confirms the path: **2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1**.
(Starting at 2, listing in order).

Let's check one more possibility: twisting the Top Cluster.
Instead of 2->7->6->9, what about **2->6->7->9**?
d(2,6) ≈ 760. (vs 2-7 ≈ 740). Worse.
d(7,9)? 7: (133, 213). 9: (719, 477).
d(7,9)^2 = 586^2 + 264^2 = 343396 + 69696 = 413092. (d ≈ 642).
d(6,9) ≈ 630.
d(7,9) is slightly worse than 6-9.
So 2-7-6-9 is better than 2-6-7-9 on both counts (entry and exit).
So Top cluster order is fixed: ... -> 7 -> 6 -> ...

Let's check twisting the Right Cluster.
Entry at 9, Exit at 8.
Current: 9-4-10-3-5-8.
Alternative: **9-10-4-3-5-8**?
d(9,10) is huge. 9 is top, 10 is bottom right. 4 is between. No.
Alternative: **9-8-5-3-10-4-?**
If we end at 4, we need to connect to 1 (bridge 4-1).
d(4,1) is massive.
We established the bridge must be near 8/5. 8 is closest to 1.
So we must exit at 8 (or 5).
If we exit at 8, we must enter at 9 (closest to 6).
So traversal 9 -> ... -> 8 is fixed.
Is 9-4-10-3-5-8 optimal?
Maybe 9-5-3-10-4-8? No, 4-8 is not a neighbor step, 5 is closer.
Maybe 9-4-10-5-3-8? 10-5?
10: (975, 843). 5: (756, 856). d ≈ 220.
3: (819, 988).
10-3 is d ≈ 213.
3-5 is d ≈ 146.
10-5 is d ≈ 220.
Path 10-3-5 is 213+146 = 359.
Path 10-5-3 is 220+146 = 366.
Very similar. But visually 3 is "below" 5 and 10.
10 is Right. 3 is Bottom. 5 is Left-Center.
Going 10->3->5 moves Right -> Bottom -> Left. Smooth.
Going 10->5->3 moves Right -> Left -> Bottom. Also valid.
But let's look at the connection to 8.
From 3 to 8? d(3,8) ≈ 269.
From 5 to 8? d(5,8) ≈ 128.
If we do 10-5-3-8, cost is 220 + 146 + 269 = 635.
If we do 10-3-5-8, cost is 213 + 146 + 128 = 487.
Clearly **10-3-5-8** is superior.

So the sequence is robust.

Final path check:
Start: **2**
Go to **1** (Must visit neighbor).
Go to **8** (Shortest inter-cluster jump).
Go to **5**
Go to **3**
Go to **10**
Go to **4**
Go to **9**
Go to **6** (Shortest bridge to top).
Go to **7**
Go to **2** (Close the loop).

Wait, earlier I said "2->1->8..." requires closing via "7->2".
And that "7->2" was the long edge.
And the total loop distance was sum of:
Segments: 2-1, 1-8, 8-5, 5-3, 3-10, 10-4, 4-9, 9-6, 6-7, 7-2.
Is there any way to avoid 7-2?
We tried the other orientation: 1-7 and 2-8.
Sum 1-7 + 2-8 + 6-9 was worse.
So the "7-2" jump is the "necessary evil" longest edge in the optimal solution.

Let's double check if starting at 2 matters for the list.
"You can start from any point". "List each point label once".
I will provide the list starting at 1 for canonical reasons, or follow the example.
Example starts at 1.
My path: 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2.
Or reversed: 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8.
Reversed direction:
1 -> 2 (short)
2 -> 7 (long)
7 -> 6 (short)
6 -> 9 (med)
9 -> 4 (med)
4 -> 10 (short)
10 -> 3 (short)
3 -> 5 (short)
5 -> 8 (short)
8 -> 1 (med)
This seems to be the one.

Let's just confirm visually that 9-4 is better than 9-5 or 9-8.
9 to 4 looks direct. 9 to 8 is further. 9 to 5 is further.
Yes.

And confirm 10-4 vs 10-3.
From 4, 10 is the only logical next step.
From 10, 3 is the only logical next step.
From 3, 5 is the only logical next step.
From 5, 8 is the only logical next step.

So the chain **9-4-10-3-5-8** is solid.

Final check of the bridge 2-7 vs 1-7.
If we do 1-7, we must do 2-8.
Comparing (1-7 + 2-8) vs (2-7 + 1-8).
(664 + 604) = 1268.
(740 + 473) = 1213.
The second option (using 1-8 and 2-7) saves ~55 units.
It is the better path.

So the list is:
**2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1**
Or shifted to start at 1:
**1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8**
Or reversed:
**1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2**

I will provide the sequence starting from 1 and going to 8 (shortest inter-cluster jump). This feels like the most robust starting move.
List: **1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2**.
Let's verify the prompt doesn't ask for a specific start. "You can start from any point".
Okay.

Let's write down the coordinates mentally again to ensure no silly mistake like "4 is left of 9".
9 is at x=719.
4 is at x=877.
4 is to the right of 9.
10 is at x=975. Right of 4.
3 is at x=819. Left of 4/10.
5 is at x=756. Left of 3.
8 is at x=661. Left of 5.
So scanning Right to Left: 10, 4, 3, 5, 9, 8.
Y coords:
9: 477 (High)
4: 747
8: 770
10: 843
5: 856
3: 988 (Low)
So 9 is high.
Then 4 and 8 are roughly same height.
Then 10 and 5 are roughly same height.
3 is bottom.
Path 9 -> 4. (High to Mid-Right). Correct.
Path 4 -> 10. (Mid-Right to Low-Right). Correct.
Path 10 -> 3. (Low-Right to Lowest). Correct.
Path 3 -> 5. (Lowest to Low-Left). Correct.
Path 5 -> 8. (Low-Left to Mid-Left). Correct.
Path 8 -> 1. (Mid-Left to Far-Left-Low). Correct.
This spiral traversal of the right cluster looks solid.

Path 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1
Let's trace:
2 -> 7 (Long jump up-left)
7 -> 6 (Right)
6 -> 9 (Right-Down)
9 -> 4 (Right-Down)
4 -> 10 (Right-Down)
10 -> 3 (Left-Down)
3 -> 5 (Left-Up)
5 -> 8 (Left-Up)
8 -> 1 (Left-Down)
1 -> 2 (Left-Down)
Loop closed.

This seems correct.

Final check. Is there a twist like 9->10->4?
9 (719, 477) -> 10 (975, 843).
dx=256, dy=366. d ≈ 446.
9 (719, 477) -> 4 (877, 747).
dx=158, dy=270. d ≈ 312.
9->4 is much closer.
Is there a twist 8->3->5?
8 (661, 770) -> 3 (819, 988).
dx=158, dy=218. d ≈ 269.
8 (661, 770) -> 5 (756, 856).
dx=95, dy=86. d ≈ 128.
8->5 is much closer.
So the ordering in the right cluster is definitely 9-4-10-3-5-8 (or reverse).

Is 6-9 the best bridge?
6 (156, 194) -> 9 (719, 477). d ≈ 630.
6 -> 8 (661, 770). dx=505, dy=576. d > 700.
6 -> 5. Further.
6 -> 4. Further.
7 -> 9. d ≈ 642. (Slightly worse).
7 -> 8. Further.
So 6-9 is the best bridge.

Is 1-8 the best bridge?
1 (199, 874) -> 8 (661, 770). d ≈ 473.
1 -> 5 (756, 856). dx=557, dy=18. d ≈ 557.
1 -> 3. Further.
2 -> 8. d ≈ 604.
2 -> 5. Further.
So 1-8 is the best bridge.

Is 7-2 the best closing link?
We established that the sum (1-8 bridge) + (6-9 bridge) + (7-2 closing) = 473 + 630 + 740 = 1843.
Alternative: (1-7 bridge) + (6-9 bridge) + (2-8 closing) = 664 + 630 + 604 = 1898.
Alternative: (1-7 bridge) + (6-4 bridge? No) ...
Alternative: (1-6 bridge?) No, 1-7 is shorter.
What if we cross the clusters differently?
Order: Left -> Right -> Top -> Left.
Left(2,1) -> Right(8...9) -> Top(6,7) -> Left(2,1).
Connections: 1-8 (473), 9-6 (630), 7-2 (740). Sum 1843.
Order: Left -> Top -> Right -> Left.
Left(2,1) -> Top(7,6) -> Right(9...8) -> Left(2,1).
Connections: 2-7 (740), 6-9 (630), 8-1 (473). Sum 1843.
It's the same set of edges, just reversed direction.

So the cycle is uniquely determined by these three bottleneck edges.
The cycle is:
1 - 8 - 5 - 3 - 10 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 2 - 1.

I will formulate the answer as this sequence.

Final Answer seems to be: 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1
(Visually tracing it again)
2 -> 7 (Jump up left)
7 -> 6 (Scooch right)
6 -> 9 (Jump across top)
9 -> 4 (Down right side)
4 -> 10 (Corner)
10 -> 3 (Bottom)
3 -> 5 (Inner hook)
5 -> 8 (Outer hook)
8 -> 1 (Jump back left)
1 -> 2 (Finish at start)

Looks perfect.

Wait, check prompt "Example: 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6".
The example doesn't repeat the start point.
"Format: List each point label once, in visit order. Do NOT repeat the first point at the end."
My list: 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1.

Let's order it starting from 1 just to be standard.
1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8.
Or
1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2.

Does the direction matter?
TSP is undirected.
The order 1, 2, 7... vs 1, 8, 5...
1, 2, 7... involves the 1-2 step then 2-7 step.
1, 8, 5... involves 1-8 step.
Both are valid representations of the same cycle. I'll provide one.
The path 1->2->7... feels slightly counter-intuitive because 2->7 is the longest link in the whole graph. Usually, you follow "nearest neighbor" heuristics.
From 1, nearest neighbor (that isn't 2) is 8.
d(1,8) = 473.
d(1,7) = 664.
So a greedy algorithm would go 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> ...
So the order **2, 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7** is the one a human or simple algorithm would likely find first.
Wait, my previous loop was ...8->1->2->7...
Which corresponds to 7, 2, 1, 8...
In that loop, 2 connects to 1 and 7.
In the greedy loop 2, 1, 8..., 2 connects to 1 and 7 (at the end).
So it's the same loop.
I will output the order starting with 2 -> 1 -> 8 ... because it follows the closest connections immediately.
Sequence: **2, 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7**
Let's check the closing 7 -> 2. Yes, that's the long one.
Wait, looking at 2, 1, 8...
Start 2.
Go to 1 (closest).
From 1, go to 8 (closest unvisited in next cluster).
From 8, go to 5 (closest).
From 5, go to 3 (closest).
From 3, go to 10 (closest).
From 10, go to 4 (closest).
From 4, go to 9 (closest).
From 9, go to 6 (closest unvisited in next cluster).
From 6, go to 7 (closest).
From 7, return to 2.
This greedy strategy works perfectly for this specific layout.
So the list is **2, 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7**.

Wait, does the example output imply sorting? No.
The example output implies a specific path.
I will provide the list starting from 1.
**1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2**

Let's check 1 -> 2 vs 1 -> 8.
From 1, 2 is dist ~140. 8 is dist ~470.
So 1 -> 2 is better locally.
So **1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8** is the other valid direction.
Why pick one over the other?
If I start at 1, the next point is 2.
If I go 1->8, I am skipping 2.
Greedy from 1: Go to 2. From 2? Go to 8 (dist 604) or 7 (dist 740)? 8 is closer.
So greedy from 1 yields: 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> (1).
Let's check the cost of this greedy loop: **1-2-8-5-3-10-4-9-6-7-1**.
Edges: 1-2, 2-8, ... 6-7, 7-1.
Sum of inter-cluster edges: d(2,8) + d(9,6) + d(7,1).
604 + 630 + 664 = 1898.
Compare to optimal: 1-8, 6-9, 2-7.
473 + 630 + 740 = 1843.
The optimal loop is shorter.
The greedy loop is worse.
The greedy loop fails because 2->8 (604) + 7->1 (664) = 1268.
The optimal loop uses 1->8 (473) + 7->2 (740) = 1213.
It saves 55 units by taking the huge 7-2 jump to allow the very short 1-8 jump.
This is a classic TSP trap.
The "crossing" edges between the left cluster {1,2} and the others determine the cost.
You have to connect {1,2} to {7,6} and {8...9}.
You need two edges connected to the set {1,2}.
One edge connects to {7,6}. Candidates: 1-7 (664), 2-7 (740), 1-6 (higher), 2-6 (higher).
One edge connects to {8...9}. Candidates: 1-8 (473), 2-8 (604), etc.
We need to pick one "Top" connection and one "Right" connection.
If we pick 1-7 and 2-8: Cost = 664 + 604 = 1268.
If we pick 1-8 and 2-7: Cost = 473 + 740 = 1213.
The second pair is minimal.
So the connections MUST be 1-8 and 2-7.
This forces the path segment ... -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...
(Since 1 and 2 must be connected to each other).
So the order is determined by this segment.
Reading the path in the direction 1 -> 8:
**1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2**
This is the optimal path.

I will provide this sequence.

One final verification on the image numbers.
Top left: 7, 6.
Bottom left: 2, 1. (2 is left of 1).
Right cluster:
Top: 9.
Left-mid: 8.
Left-low: 5.
Bottom: 3.
Right-low: 10.
Right-mid: 4.
This matches my mental map.

Sequence: 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 2.
Closing 2 -> 1.
Path order: 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2

Let me try to start from 2 to make it look "sequential" if possible.
2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1
This is the reverse. Also valid.
I'll stick with starting at 1.

Wait, is there any ambiguity about 10 and 4 position?
4 is labelled "4" near a dot. 10 is labelled "10" near a dot.
4 is above 10.
Y(4) = 747. Y(10) = 843.
Yes.
X(4) = 877. X(10) = 975.
Yes.
Order 9 -> 4 -> 10.
Distance 9-4 approx 312.
Distance 9-10 approx 446.
So 9->4 is correct.

Order 10 -> 3 vs 10 -> 5.
Distance 10-3 approx 213.
Distance 10-5 approx 220.
3 is visually closer and "next" along the perimeter. 5 is interior.
If we go 10-5, then 5-3, then 3-8?
Cost 10-5-3-8 = 220 + 146 + 269 = 635.
Cost 10-3-5-8 = 213 + 146 + 128 = 487.
So 10-3-5-8 is strictly better.

Confirmed. The list is solid.

Final Output List: 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9, 6, 7, 2
Or reversed: 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8

I will provide the one starting with 1, 2... because 1-2 is the shortest edge in the graph (d~140). It feels most natural to traverse that first.
Wait, if I traverse 1->2 first, I am committing to the path 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8.
This corresponds to the optimal edge set.
So I will provide this one.

List: **1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8**
Check again.
1-2 (Short)
2-7 (Long, 740)
7-6 (Short)
6-9 (Med, 630)
9-4 (Med)
4-10 (Short)
10-3 (Short)
3-5 (Short)
5-8 (Short)
8-1 (Med, 473)
Total "Gap" cost = 740 + 630 + 473 = 1843.
This is the minimal gap cost configuration.
This is the correct answer.

Let's double check if 3 -> 8 -> 5 is better?
3 -> 8 (269)
8 -> 5 (128)
5 -> 1 (557)
Total 3-8-5-1 = 269+128+557 = 954.
My path 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 1 = 146+128+473 = 747.
Path via 5 then 8 is much better.

Ok, ready.

Format: Comma separated list.
1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8.

Just in case, check 6 -> 7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8...
Order: 6, 7, 2, 1, 8, 5, 3, 10, 4, 9.
Closing 9 -> 6.
Yes.

I will write the answer starting at 1.

One final check on point 3.
Is 3 lower than 5? Yes.
Is 3 right of 5? Yes.
Is 3 left of 10? Yes.
Sequence 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8.
10 (Right) -> 3 (Bottom-Center) -> 5 (Left-Center) -> 8 (Left).
Smooth traversal.
If we swap 3 and 5?
10 -> 5 -> 3 -> 8.
Right -> Left-Center -> Bottom-Center -> Left.
This is zigzag. 10 to 5 goes left-up. 5 to 3 goes right-down. 3 to 8 goes left-up.
Zigzag increases distance.
Circular (10->3->5->8) is better.

The sequence is definitely 10, 3, 5, 8.

Final Result: 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8.
