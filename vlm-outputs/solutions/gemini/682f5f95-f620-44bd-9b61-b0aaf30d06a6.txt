Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest path that connects all points into a single loop (Traveling Salesman Tour) is as follows:

1.  Start at the top left cluster: **8, 6**.
2.  Move slightly down to: **1**.
3.  Go further down and left to the outlier: **10**.
4.  Move towards the bottom: **3**.
5.  Continue along the bottom edge: **11, 14**.
6.  Move up slightly to: **7, 15**.
7.  Go up to the central-left area: **17**.
8.  Move up to the upper central cluster: **12, 16, 18, 9**.
9.  From 9, cross the large gap to the right side cluster. The closest points on the right are near the top/middle. Let's re-evaluate the crossing. Actually, a better flow is probably to finish the left side and cross over, or weave through the middle.

Let's trace a more logical perimeter path to minimize crossing lines:

1.  **Top-Left:** Start at **6**, go to **8**.
2.  **Down-Left:** Go down to **1**, then out to **10**.
3.  **Bottom-Left:** Go across to **3**.
4.  **Bottom-Center:** Continue to **11**, then **14**.
5.  **Bottom-Right:** From 14, go to the bottom-most point on the right side: **2**.
6.  **Right-Cluster (upwards):** From 2, move up to **19**, then out to **4**, then **13**, **5**, and **20**.
7.  **Crossing back to Center:** From 20 (the left-most of the right cluster), jump across the gap to the central points. The closest is likely **15** or **7**. Let's aim for the bottom-center cluster first to avoid crossing paths later.
    *   *Correction*: From 20, jumping to 15/7 creates a crossing with the path from 14->2. Let's rethink the connection between the left/center group and the right group.
    *   The gap is largest between the center group (12,16,18,17,15,7) and the right group (2,19,4,13,5,20).
    *   The bridge should probably happen at the top (9 to somewhere) or bottom (14 to 2). Let's try a circular sweep.

**Revised Path Tracing (Counter-Clockwise Sweep):**

1.  Start top-left: **6**.
2.  Go to neighbor: **8**.
3.  Down to: **1**.
4.  Out to: **10**.
5.  Across bottom to: **3**.
6.  To: **11**.
7.  To: **14**.
8.  Bridge the gap to the right side: **2**.
9.  Up the right side: **19**.
10. To the edge: **4**.
11. Up to: **13**.
12. Up to: **5**.
13. In to: **20**.
14. Now bridge back to the center/top. From 20, the closest logical point is likely in the central vertical strip. Let's target the bottom of that strip to move upwards, or top to move downwards.
    *   Actually, point **7** and **15** are quite low. Point **17** is middle.
    *   Let's look at the gap between 20 and the rest. It's wide.
    *   Let's look at the gap between 5/20 and 18.
    *   Let's try a "C" shape path for the center cluster inserted into the loop.

**Let's try connecting nearest neighbors logically:**

*   **Left Cluster:** 8-6-1-10 is a strong local group, but 10 is far. 6-8 is tight. 1-8 is okay. 1-10 is the only way to get to 10 efficiently without backtracking.
    *   Path: ...9 -> 8 -> 6 -> 1 -> 10 -> 3...
*   **Bottom:** 3 -> 11 -> 14 is a clear line.
*   **Right Cluster:** 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20.
    *   Sequence: 14 -> 2 -> 19 -> 4 -> 13 -> 5 -> 20.
*   **Return Trip (Center):** Now we are at 20. We need to pick up 15, 7, 17, 16, 12, 18, 9 and close the loop back to start (let's say 9 connects to 8).
    *   From 20, go to **15**.
    *   From 15, go to **7** (they are very close).
    *   From 7, go up to **17**.
    *   From 17, go to **16**? Or **12**? 16 is closer.
    *   From 16, go to **12**.
    *   From 12, go to **18**.
    *   From 18, go to **9**.
    *   From 9, go to **8**.

**Let's verify this loop:**
8 -> 6 -> 1 -> 10 -> 3 -> 11 -> 14 -> 2 -> 19 -> 4 -> 13 -> 5 -> 20 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9 -> (back to 8)

Let's check for crossings or inefficient jumps.
*   20 -> 15: This is a long jump, but unavoidable to cross the gap.
*   17 -> 16 -> 12: Looks clean.
*   12 -> 18 -> 9: Looks clean.
*   9 -> 8: This is a bit of a jump across the top, but 9 is isolated. Is there a better way?
    *   Maybe 18 -> 9 -> 6 -> 8?
        *   If 18->9->6->8... then from 8 where do we go? To 1. Then 1->10. This works.
    *   Let's compare 9->8 vs 9->6. Visually 9 is closer to 8. But 6 is "behind" 8 relative to 9. So 9->8->6->1 is smoother.

**Let's refine the bottom center:**
*   3 -> 11 -> 14.
*   After 14, we go to 2.
*   Is there a point we missed? 7 and 15 are "hanging" in the middle.
*   Maybe 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> (cross to right) -> 20...
    *   If 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20... then how do we get to 2?
    *   We would have to come down the right side: 5->13->4->19->2.
    *   Then from 2 cross back to... where? We've used 14. We would need to cross to 17? That's a huge diagonal jump. Unlikely.

The previous path (Outer shell loop) seems most robust:
Left Side Down -> Bottom -> Right Side Up -> Cross Left to Center -> Up Center -> Back to Start.

Let's re-verify the "Center Up" segment.
From 20 (top of right inner), the closest central point is 15 or 17?
Actually, looking at the coordinates:
20 is roughly same height as 17.
15 and 7 are lower.
So a path 20 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17 involves backtracking up/down.
Maybe the Right Cluster should be traversed differently?
Start bottom right: 14 -> 2 -> 19 -> 4 -> 13 -> 5 -> 20.
From 20, go to **17**? Or **15**?
Visual distance check: 20 to 15 vs 20 to 17. 15 looks slightly closer or similar.
However, 7 and 15 are a tight pair. 7 is lower than 15.
17 is higher.
So traversing 7-15-17 moves upwards.
Traversing 17-15-7 moves downwards.

If we move downwards (17-15-7), we end at 7. From 7, where do we go?
To 14? 14 is already connected to 11 and 2.
So we must insert the {7, 15, 17} group into the flow.
Could it be: 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 14?
*   11 to 7 is a jump up. 7 to 15 is tiny up. 15 to 14 is a jump down.
*   Then 14 to 2.
*   This detours the smooth bottom line (11-14).
*   However, 14 is very low. 7 and 15 are significantly higher.
*   11 -> 14 is a straight shot.
*   Maybe 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17... then cross to right? No, 17 is far from right.

Let's stick to the perimeter theory, it usually solves these best.
Points 7, 15, 17, 16, 12, 18 are "interior" points relative to the outer ring of 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 4, 5, 9, 6, 8.
Standard TSP heuristic: Visit the convex hull, inserting interior points where cost is minimal.

**Current best candidate path:**
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 15, 7, 17, 16, 12, 18, 9

**Critique:**
*   **20 -> 15:** A long horizontal jump. Is there a shorter bridge?
    *   Maybe 5 -> 18? (Top right to top center). No, 5 is lower than 18.
    *   Maybe 20 -> 17? Similar to 20->15.
    *   Maybe 14 -> 7? Then up the middle, then cross to right at top?
        *   Path: ...11 -> 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9 -> (cross to right) -> 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 19 -> 20 -> 2? No, 2 is bottom.
        *   Path: ...11 -> 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9 -> 5 -> 13 -> 20 -> 4 -> 19 -> 2. Then 2 back to start? 2 to 10? No way.
    *   We need the loop to close. The gap between Left/Center and Right is the main constraint. We must cross it twice.
    *   Crossing 1: Bottom (14 -> 2).
    *   Crossing 2: Top/Middle (20 -> 15/17/18? or 5 -> 9/18?).
    *   Let's look at 20 -> 15 vs 20 -> 17 vs 5 -> 18.
    *   20 -> 15 seems the most "neighborly" bridge in the middle band.
    *   Let's check the sequence within the center cluster. If we arrive at 15 from 20:
        *   15 -> 7 (down slightly).
        *   7 -> 17 (up).
        *   This zig-zags. 20 is higher than 15. 15 is higher than 7.
        *   Maybe 20 -> 17? Then 17 -> 15 -> 7? Then from 7... dead end? No.
        *   We need to move generally "Left" and "Up" to get back to 9/8.
        *   If we are at 7, we are low. To get to 9 (high), we need to climb.
        *   So entering at the bottom of the center stack (7 or 15) and exiting at the top (18) makes sense.
        *   Therefore, the bridge 20 -> 15/7 is better than entering at 18.
    *   Sequence: 20 -> 15 -> 7 is awkward because 7 is a dead end node visually below 15.
    *   Better: 20 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17. (7 is further from 20 than 15 is).
    *   Let's look at **20 -> 17**.
        *   17 -> 15 -> 7. Now at 7. How to go up?
        *   We are stuck at the bottom.
    *   Let's reconsider the cluster 7/15.
        *   Maybe the path comes from the bottom left?
        *   3 -> 7 -> 15 -> 11? No, crossing lines.
        *   11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 14?
            *   11 (bottom) up to 7, up to 15, down to 14.
            *   Then 14 -> 2...
            *   This effectively absorbs 7 and 15 into the bottom line.
            *   Let's trace the rest: ... -> 2 -> 19 -> 4 -> 13 -> 5 -> 20 -> 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9 -> 8...
            *   This looks VERY promising. It removes the awkward 20->15 jump. Now we have 20->17 which is a cleaner horizontal jump. And 15->14 is a clean drop.
            *   Let's check 11 -> 7. 11 is bottom left-ish. 7 is mid-center-low. 3 -> 11 is tight. 11 -> 14 is tight.
            *   If we do 11 -> 7, we skip the 11-14 edge. The distance 11->7 is larger than 11->14. Distance 15->14 is medium.
            *   Compare total cost:
                *   Option A (Perimeter): 11->14->...->20->15->7->17... (Cost: Edge 11-14 (short) + Jump 20-15 (long) + 7-17 (medium))
                *   Option B (Absorption): 11->7->15->14->...->20->17... (Cost: Edge 11-7 (medium/long) + 15-14 (medium) + 20-17 (long)).
            *   Visually, 11->14 is very short. Breaking it is expensive. The jump 20->15 is the problem to solve.

Let's look closer at the Right Cluster.
2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20.
Is 20 -> 17 really the best exit?
What if we exit from 5? 5 is high up.
5 -> 18? No, huge gap.
5 -> 9? Huge gap.

Let's look at the Center Cluster again.
12, 16, 17, 15, 7, 18.
18 is top. 7 is bottom.
If we flow 9 -> 18 -> 12 -> 16 -> 17 -> 15 -> 7...
Then from 7 we need to go to the right side? Or the bottom?
7 -> 14? Then 14 -> 2...
This direction: Start 8->6->1->10->3->11.
From 11, go up to the center stack?
11 -> 7? (Leaving 14 for later?)
If 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9.
Now at 9. Must cross to right.
9 -> 5? (Long). 9 -> 20? (Long).
Then down the right side ... -> 2 -> 14.
Then 14 back to start (8)? No, 14 is bottom, 8 is top.
We need to close the loop 14 -> 11? We started 11->7.
So loop is: 8..11 -> 7..9 -> 5..2 -> 14 -> 11??
Check connection 14 -> 11. Yes, they are close.
Check connection 11 -> 7. Medium jump.
Check connection 9 -> 5. Long jump.
This creates a "Snake" path: Up the middle, Down the right.
Is 9 -> 5 shorter than 20 -> 15? Visually, 9-5 is very long. 20-15 is shorter.
So the Right-to-Center bridge should be in the middle (20-15 or 20-17).

**Back to the Perimeter Loop:**
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 15, 7, 17, 16, 12, 18, 9.

Let's optimize the specific segments.
**Segment: 20, 15, 7, 17, 16, 12.**
*   From 20, closest is 15.
*   From 15, closest is 7.
*   From 7, closest is... 17 is far. 14 is closer (but visited). 11 is far.
*   This is the bottleneck. Point 7 is a "cul-de-sac".
*   If we visit 15 then 7, we are stuck at 7. We must backtrack or make a long jump from 7 to 17.
*   Is there a way to visit 7 "on the way" to 15?
    *   20 -> 17 -> 7 -> 15?
    *   17 to 7 is long. 7 to 15 is short.
    *   This order (17-7-15) leaves us at 15.
    *   From 15, where to? 16? 15 to 16 is medium.
*   Let's rethink the center structure.
    *   It's a vertical line: 18 (top), 12, 16, 17, 15, 7 (bottom).
    *   We enter from the right (20). We exit to the left/top (9/8).
    *   We need to traverse this vertical line efficiently.
    *   Entry point: 17 or 15.
    *   Exit point: 18 or 12.
    *   If we enter at 15/7, we should move UP.
    *   20 -> 15 -> 7 (dead end).
    *   20 -> 7 -> 15? (20 to 7 is longer than 20 to 15).
    *   Maybe 20 -> 17 -> 16 -> 15 -> 7?
        *   20 to 17 (ok).
        *   17 to 16 (short).
        *   16 to 15 (medium/long - crossing 17?). No, 16 is left of 17. 15 is below 17. 16 to 15 is clear.
        *   15 to 7 (short).
        *   From 7... long jump to 12? No.
    *   Maybe the connection to the bottom row is the key.
    *   What if 7 connects to 11 or 14?
    *   Recalling the "Absorption" idea:
        *   11 -> 14 is the base.
        *   If we do 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20... (leaves 14 stranded? No, 14 connects to 2).
        *   ...3 -> 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20 -> 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 19 -> 2 -> 14 -> (where does 14 go?).
        *   If 14 goes to 17? No, huge jump.
        *   If 14 goes to 16/12? No.
    *   What if we wind around?
        *   ...3 -> 11 -> 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20...?
        *   14 back to 7? 14 is right of 11. 7 is above between them.
        *   14 -> 7 is a clean vertical line.
        *   Then 7 -> 15 -> 20.
        *   So: ...3 -> 11 -> 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20...
        *   The bridge is now 15 -> 20.
        *   And 14 -> 2 is BROKEN.
        *   If we break 14->2, how do we get to the right cluster?
        *   15 -> 20 works.
        *   We do the right cluster: 20 -> 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 19 -> 2.
        *   Now at 2. We need to go back to the center/left.
        *   From 2, huge jump to 17? 16? 12?
        *   This seems bad. 2 is isolated at the bottom right. The only good neighbor is 14 or 19.
        *   So the link 14-2-19... must be maintained.

**Conclusion:** The link 14 -> 2 is critical.
This implies we pass below 7 and 15.
So 7 and 15 must be visited AFTER the right cluster loop, on the return trip.
Return trip starts at 20.
Path: 20 -> 15.
From 15, we must go to 7.
From 7, we must go UP to the rest of the center (17, 16, 12, 18).
This implies a jump 7 -> 17?
Or 7 -> 16?
Or maybe 15 -> 17, and 7 is visited some other way?
No, 7 is hanging off 15.
What if 20 -> 7? (Diagonal). Then 7 -> 15. Then 15 -> 17.
This sequence (20 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17) looks viable.
*   20 -> 7 is longer than 20 -> 15.
*   But 7 -> 15 is short.
*   15 -> 17 is short/medium.
*   17 -> 16 is short.
*   16 -> 12 is short.
*   12 -> 18 is short.
*   18 -> 9 is medium.
*   9 -> 8 is medium.
This seems the most logical topological sort of the points.

Let's check the alternative for the "7 problem":
What if 17 -> 7 -> 15? No, 7 is below 15.
What if 16 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17? No.
What if 12 -> 16 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17? No.

Maybe the order in the center is:
17 -> 15 -> 7 -> (jump) -> 16 -> 12?
Jump 7 to 16 is long.

Let's re-evaluate **20 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17**.
Is 7 -> 17 really that bad?
7 is at y=low. 17 is at y=mid.
There are no points in between. It's a straight shot up.
It crosses the imaginary line of 20->15? No.
20 is right. 15 is left. 7 is below 15. 17 is above 15.
Path: 20 (right) -> 7 (bottom-center) -> 15 (mid-center) -> 17 (upper-mid-center).
Wait, 7 is below 15.
So 20 -> 7 goes down-left.
7 -> 15 goes up.
15 -> 17 goes up.
This works perfectly linearly.
Is 20 -> 7 clear?
It passes "under" 15. It might be close to 15.
But 20 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17 involves backtracking at 15 (down to 7 then back up past 15 to 17).
Going 20 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17 is a smoother "sweep".
Let's look at the distance:
dist(20, 15) < dist(20, 7).
dist(15, 17) ~ dist(7, 17) - dist(7, 15). Actually 7->17 is dist(7,15)+dist(15,17) roughly since they are collinear.
So 20->15->7->17 traverses 15-7 twice geometrically.
20->7->15->17 traverses 20-7 (hypotenuse) then 7-15 then 15-17.
By triangle inequality, going to the furthest point (7) first from the side (20) is usually longer than going to the middle (15) then end (7).
BUT, if we go to middle (15) then end (7), we are stuck at the end. We have to come back.
So we pay the cost of the "return" trip (7 to 17).
Cost A: 20->15 + 15->7 + 7->17.
Cost B: 20->7 + 7->15 + 15->17.
Visually:
20 is at (X, Y). 15 is at (x, y). 7 is at (x, y-d). 17 is at (x, y+d).
Cost A ~ (X-x) + d + 2d = X-x + 3d.
Cost B ~ sqrt((X-x)^2 + d^2) + d + d.
If X-x is large (the gap is wide), then sqrt((X-x)^2 + d^2) is roughly (X-x).
So Cost B ~ X-x + 2d.
Cost B is lower. It avoids the double-back "cul-de-sac" penalty.
So **20 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17** is likely superior to 20 -> 15 -> 7 -> 17.

Let's double check 17 vs 16.
17 is right of 16.
15 is right of 7? No, roughly vertical.
15 is right of 16? Yes.
So 15 -> 17 -> 16 makes sense (moving left).
Then 16 -> 12 -> 18.

**Revised Path:**
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 16, 12, 18, 9.

Let's refine the start/end connection (9 back to 8).
9 is top-center. 8 is top-left.
Straight shot. No obstacles.
Loop closed.

Let's confirm the "Right Cluster" order.
14 -> 2 -> 19 -> 4 -> 13 -> 5 -> 20.
Is there a better way?
Maybe 14 -> 2 -> 20 -> 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 19?
If we end at 19, crossing back to center is hard (19 is low/right).
If we end at 20, crossing is good (20 is mid/right).
So ending at 20 is correct.
Sequence 2 -> 19 -> 4 -> 13 -> 5 -> 20 is a clean sweep up the outside edge.
Is 2 -> 20 -> ... better?
2 -> 20 skips 19.
2 -> 19 -> 20? 19 is outside.
Order 2, 19, 4, 13, 5 is a convex hull walk. It's optimal.
20 is inside the hull slightly?
Actually 20 is left of 5.
So 5 -> 20 is good.

**Final check on indices:**
Start: 8
8 -> 6 (up-right)
6 -> 1 (down)
1 -> 10 (down-left)
10 -> 3 (down-right)
3 -> 11 (right)
11 -> 14 (right-down)
14 -> 2 (right-up-ish jump)
2 -> 19 (up-right)
19 -> 4 (up-right)
4 -> 13 (up-left)
13 -> 5 (up)
5 -> 20 (left-down)
20 -> 7 (left-down, long jump) -- *Wait, check 20 -> 7 vs 20 -> 17 again.*
If 20->17, then 17->15->7... stuck.
If 20->7, then 7->15->17... good flow up.
What about 20->15?
20->15, then 15->17... skips 7? No, must visit 7.
If 20->15->7->(backtrack)->17. This is the "bad" one.
Is there a 20 -> 17 -> 15 -> 7 -> 11??
No, we already visited 11.
What if we visit 7/15 on the way OUT?
11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 14?
Cost: Break 11-14 (short). Add 11-7 (med), 7-15 (short), 15-14 (med). Total penalty: med+med+short - short = 2*med.
Cost of 20-7 jump: Long.
This is tricky.
Let's visually simulate 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 14.
It creates a "bubble" on the bottom line.
Then we do the right loop ... -> 20.
From 20, we need to get to 17/16/12.
20 -> 17 is a clean horizontal jump. Much shorter than 20 -> 7 diagonal.
So, if we incorporate 7/15 into the bottom line, we save the massive return diagonal.
Is 11->7->15->14 valid?
15 to 14 is a bit backward. 15 is higher than 14.
Does 11->15->7->14 work?
11 to 15 (long). 15 to 7 (short). 7 to 14 (short).
11->7->15->14 looks geometrically smoother than 11->15->7->14.
But is it better than the Perimeter approach?
The Perimeter approach forces a "return" path through the center column.
If we strip 7/15 from that column, the return path is just 20 -> 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9. This is very straight.
The detour 11->7->15->14 is a "local" detour.
The jump 20->7 is a "global" jump.
Usually local detours are cheaper than global bad edges.
Let's check the distance 15->14.
15 is at (x, y). 14 is at (x, y-h). 7 is at (x, y-h/2).
14 is actually quite far right of 11. 7 is in between x-wise?
Looking at the image:
11 is at x=350. 14 is x=450.
7 is x=480? No, 7 is above 14 roughly.
15 is above 7.
So 7 and 15 are almost directly above 14.
Sequence 11 -> 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20?
11 to 14 (good).
14 to 7 (up).
7 to 15 (up).
15 to 20 (right).
Then 20... right cluster loop... end at 2.
2 to... where?
We need to get back to 17/16.
2 to 17? Huge diagonal across everything. Terrible.
So we cannot exit right cluster at 2.
We must exit right cluster at 20.
This implies we enter right cluster at 2.
This implies we come from 14.
This implies the sequence 14 -> 2 is fixed.
This implies we can't do 14 -> 7 -> 15 -> 20.

So 7 and 15 must be visited either:
1. Before 14 (on the way there): 11 -> 7 -> 15 -> 14.
   - 11 to 7 is a jump. 15 to 14 is a jump back down.
   - Then 14 -> 2 -> ... -> 20 -> 17...
2. After 20 (on the way back): 20 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17 (or 20->15->7->17).

Let's compare distance:
Path 1 (Detour):
   Remove 11-14.
   Add 11-7, 7-15, 15-14.
   Add 20-17.
Path 2 (Return Sweep):
   Keep 11-14.
   Add 20-7, 7-15, 15-17.

Visually:
11 to 14 is very efficient.
11 to 7 is diagonal up.
15 to 14 is vertical down.
20 to 17 is horizontal left.
20 to 7 is diagonal down-left (long).

Let's look at the coordinates roughly.
20 is (800, 600).
17 is (400, 600).
7 is (500, 800).
15 is (500, 750).
11 is (400, 900).
14 is (450, 950).
(Y increases downwards).

Path 1 Distances:
11(400,900) -> 7(500,800) ~ 141 px
7(500,800) -> 15(500,750) ~ 50 px
15(500,750) -> 14(450,950) ~ 206 px
20(800,600) -> 17(400,600) ~ 400 px
Total added segments: 141+50+206+400 = 797.
Removed: 11->14 ~ 70 px. Net cost ~ 727.

Path 2 Distances:
11(400,900) -> 14(450,950) ~ 70 px (kept)
20(800,600) -> 7(500,800) ~ sqrt(300^2 + 200^2) = 360 px
7(500,800) -> 15(500,750) ~ 50 px
15(500,750) -> 17(400,600) ~ sqrt(100^2 + 150^2) = 180 px
Total added segments: 360 + 50 + 180 = 590.
Net cost ~ 590.

Path 2 is significantly shorter (590 vs 727).
The "Return Sweep" visiting 7 and 15 on the way back from 20 is better.
The sequence 20 -> 7 -> 15 -> 17 avoids the cul-de-sac.
Is 20 -> 7 (360px) better than 20 -> 15 (335px) + 15->7 (50px) + 7->17 (223px)?
Path 2a (20->7->15->17): 360 + 50 + 180 = 590.
Path 2b (20->15->7->17): 335 + 50 + 223 = 608.
They are very close. 20->7 is safer to avoid sharp turns.
Visually, 20 is "above" 7. 15 is "above" 7.
So 20 -> 7 is going "under" 15.
Then 7 -> 15 is going up.
Then 15 -> 17 is going up-left.
This flow is smooth.
20 -> 15 -> 7 is a zig-zag (Left, Down). Then 7 -> 17 (Up-Left).
A "V" shape detour.
The smooth curve 20->7->15->17 is better.

Wait, check point 16.
17 is (400, 600).
16 is (450, 350)? No, 16 is near 12.
12 is (350, 320). 16 is (450, 340).
18 is (480, 280).
9 is (250, 150).
So from 17(400, 600) we go to 16(450, 340). This is Up.
Then 16 -> 12 (Left).
Then 12 -> 18 (Right-Up).
Then 18 -> 9 (Left-Up).
This looks fine.

What about 17 -> 12 -> 16 -> 18?
17 is left of 16? No 17 is left-ish. 16 is right-ish.
17 is roughly x=430. 16 is x=460.
12 is x=380.
So 17 is between 12 and 16 in X.
But 17 is much lower in Y.
So going 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18?
17 -> 16 (Up-Right).
16 -> 12 (Left).
12 -> 18 (Right-Up).
Zig-zags.
17 -> 12 (Up-Left).
12 -> 16 (Right).
16 -> 18 (Up).
18 -> 9 (Left).
This (17->12->16->18) looks slightly less zig-zaggy?
Let's check 16 vs 12 vs 18 positions.
12 and 16 are a pair. 18 is above them.
12 is left, 16 is right.
We are coming from 17 (below, center).
We need to exit to 9 (top left).
Ending at 18 makes sense to jump to 9? Or ending at 12?
18 is closer to 9? No, 18 is right. 12 is left. 12 is closer to 9.
So we should end the center sequence at 12 or 18?
Actually, 9 is quite far left.
Distance 18->9 vs 12->9.
18 is (480, 280). 9 is (270, 170). Dist = sqrt(210^2 + 110^2) = 237.
12 is (380, 320). 9 is (270, 170). Dist = sqrt(110^2 + 150^2) = 186.
12 is closer to 9.
So we should try to end at 12.
Sequence: ... -> 17 -> 16 -> 18 -> 12 -> 9.
Let's trace:
17 -> 16 (Up).
16 -> 18 (Up).
18 -> 12 (Down-Left).
12 -> 9 (Up-Left).
This has a backtrack 18->12. 18 is highest. 12 is lower.
Sequence ... -> 17 -> 12 -> 16 -> 18 -> 9.
17 -> 12 (Up-Left).
12 -> 16 (Right).
16 -> 18 (Up).
18 -> 9 (Left).
This looks cleaner.
Let's compare 17 -> 16 vs 17 -> 12.
17 is (430, 600). 16 is (460, 340). 12 is (380, 320).
17 is closer to 16 or 12? Visually equidistant.
12 is further left. 16 is "above" 17 more directly.
If we go 17->16->18->12->9. 18 to 12 is the problem.
If we go 17->12->16->18->9. 18 to 9 is the problem (longer than 12->9).
However, 16->18 is very short. 12->16 is short.
12->18 is medium.
16->18->9 cost = Short + Long.
16->12->9 cost = Short + Medium.
12->16->18->9 cost = Short + Short + Long.
Let's look at 17 -> 16 -> 18 -> 9? (Skipping 12? No must visit).
So:
A: 17 -> 16 -> 18 -> 12 -> 9.
B: 17 -> 12 -> 16 -> 18 -> 9.
C: 17 -> 16 -> 12 -> 18 -> 9.
   16->12 is left. 12->18 is right-up. 18->9 is left-up.
   This crosses itself? 16->12 and 18->9 don't cross.
   12->18 and 18->9 makes a sharp angle.
   12->18 goes Right. 18->9 goes Left. Backtrack.
   So C is bad.
D: 17 -> 18 -> 16 -> 12 -> 9.
   17 to 18 is a jump past 16. Bad.

Comparison A vs B.
A: ...16 (up) -> 18 (up) -> 12 (left-down) -> 9 (left-up). 12 is "in the pocket" between 16/18/9.
B: ...12 (up-left) -> 16 (right) -> 18 (up) -> 9 (left).
B sweeps Left -> Right -> Up -> Left.
A sweeps Up -> Up -> Left -> Left.
Geometrically, B circles the cluster {12, 16, 18} counter-clockwise.
A circles it clockwise? No.
Center of {12,16,18} is roughly (430, 310).
12 is left, 16 right, 18 top.
Visiting order 12->16->18 is CCW.
Visiting order 16->18->12 is CCW.
Entry is from 17 (bottom). Exit is to 9 (top-left).
We enter from bottom. 17 -> 12 (left) or 17 -> 16 (right).
If we go 17->12 (left), we are on the left side.
Then 12->16 (cross to right).
Then 16->18 (up).
Then 18->9 (cross back left).
This is a zig-zag. Left, Right, Left.
If we go 17->16 (right).
Then 16->18 (up).
Then 18->12 (left).
Then 12->9 (left).
This is Right, Left, Left. Only one direction change.
This (A) seems smoother.
Also 18->12 brings us closer to 9.
So **17 -> 16 -> 18 -> 12 -> 9** is the winner.

Wait, check 16->12 vs 16->18.
16 and 18 are VERY close. 16 and 12 are close.
18 and 12 are... medium.
Is 16 closer to 18 or 12? 16 is (450, 340). 18 is (480, 280). 12 is (380, 320).
Dist 16-18 ~ sqrt(30^2 + 60^2) ~ 67.
Dist 16-12 ~ sqrt(70^2 + 20^2) ~ 73.
Very similar.
However, 18 is "above" 12. 12 is "left" of 18.
If we do 16->18, we go up.
Then 18->12, we go down-left.
Then 12->9, we go up-left.
The down-move 18->12 is counter-productive to reaching 9 (up).
BUT 18->9 is a long jump. 12->9 is a medium jump.
Does the saving on 12->9 outweigh the backtrack 18->12?
18->9 ~ 237. 12->9 ~ 186. Saving = 51.
18->12 ~ sqrt(100^2 + 40^2) ~ 107.
So we pay 107 to save 51. Not worth it.
Direct 18->9 is better than detouring to 12.
This implies 12 should be visited BEFORE 18.
So order B: 17 -> 12 -> 16 -> 18 -> 9.
Check 17 -> 12.
17(430, 600) -> 12(380, 320).
17(430, 600) -> 16(460, 340).
17 is almost vertically below 12 and 16.
17->12 is slightly shorter/similar to 17->16.
But 12->16 is horizontal. 16->18 is vertical. 18->9 is diagonal.
Path: Up-Left -> Right -> Up -> Left.
This seems totally fine.
So: **... 17, 12, 16, 18, 9 ...**

Let's re-verify 16->12->18.
16->12 (Left).
12->18 (Up-Right).
18->9 (Left).
Zig-zag.
12->16 (Right).
16->18 (Up).
18->9 (Left).
Smooth turn.
So **12 -> 16 -> 18** is the correct internal order.

So the full sequence is:
Start 8.
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20.
Then **7, 15, 17**. (Using the 20->7 smooth sweep).
Then **12, 16, 18**.
Then **9**.
Loop to 8.

Let's do a final visual check on 20->7 vs 20->15.
20 is high right. 7 is low center. 15 is mid center.
If I draw a line 20->7, does it cross anything? No.
If I draw 20->15, no.
20->7 sets up 7->15 (vertical up).
20->15 sets up 15->7 (vertical down).
Then from 7 we need to go to 17 (high up).
So 7->17 is a long vertical line.
7->15 is short vertical.
15->17 is short vertical.
So 20->7->15->17 is [Long Diagonal] + [Short Up] + [Short Up].
20->15->7->17 is [Med Diagonal] + [Short Down] + [Long Up].
The "Long Up" (7->17) basically retraces the "Short Down" (15->7) plus the 15->17 distance.
Geometrically: A->B->C where C is between A and B? No.
17 is top. 15 middle. 7 bottom.
Path 1: Enter 7. 7->15->17. Monotonic upward progress. Good.
Path 2: Enter 15. 15->7. 7->17. Down then Big Up. Bad.
So **20, 7, 15, 17** is definitely correct.

Final Sequence Candidate:
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 12, 16, 18, 9

Wait, check 17 -> 12 vs 17 -> 16.
17(430,600). 12(380,320). 16(460,340).
12 is slightly further away from 17 than 16 is? (Vertical diff 280 vs 260).
But 12 sets up the CCW rotation {12,16,18}.
17->16 sets up CW rotation {16,12,18}? No.
16->12->18. 12 is left of 16. 18 is right of 12.
This is a zig-zag.
So 12->16->18 is the geometric curve.
Thus we must enter at 12.
So 17->12.

Final Sequence Confirmation:
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 12, 16, 18, 9

One last check: 1 vs 10 vs 3.
1->10->3.
1 is (200, 380). 10 is (50, 600). 3 is (260, 860).
1->3? No, 10 is way out there. 1->10 is necessary. 10->3 is necessary.
Is 6->1 correct? 6 is top. 1 is below. Yes.
Is 8->6 correct? Yes.
Is 9->8 correct? 9(270,170) -> 8(90,120). Yes.

Looks solid.

Start point in prompt: "You can start from any point".
I will list starting from 1 to be canonical, or just follow my derivation.
Prompt example: 1, 5, 3...
I'll provide the list starting from 8 as derived.

Order: 8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 12, 16, 18, 9

Double check the comma separation and format.
"List each point label once, in visit order. Do NOT repeat the first point at the end."

Let's consider if 20->17 is better than 20->7.
If 20->17, we skip 7, 15?
We must insert 7, 15.
If 20->17... then 17->15->7? Then 7->12? (Huge jump).
Then 7->16? (Huge jump).
So 7 must be a leaf or start of a chain.
Since we come from 20, 7 is the best entry point for the upward chain.
So 20->7 is the only logical choice to maintain monotonicity.

Final check on 12 vs 16.
17 is (430,600).
12 is (380,320).
16 is (460,340).
17->16 is (30, -260). Length ~261.
17->12 is (-50, -280). Length ~284.
16 is closer.
If we go 17->16, we must do 16->12->18? Or 16->18->12?
16->18 (30, -60). Length 67.
18->12 (-100, 40). Length 107.
12->9 (-110, -150). Length 186.
Total from 17: 261 + 67 + 107 + 186 = 621.
Path via 12:
17->12 (284).
12->16 (80, 20). Length 82.
16->18 (67).
18->9 (237).
Total from 17: 284 + 82 + 67 + 237 = 670.

Path A (17->16->18->12->9) distance ~ 621.
Path B (17->12->16->18->9) distance ~ 670.

Wait, why did I think A was bad?
"16->12 (Left). 12->18 (Right-Up). 18->9 (Left)."
12 is left of 16. 18 is right of 12. 9 is left of 18.
Left, Right, Left.
Zig-zag.
But look at the distances. 16->18 is super short. 18->12 is medium. 12->9 is medium.
vs
12->16 (short). 16->18 (super short). 18->9 (long).
The penalty of 18->9 (237) vs 12->9 (186) is ~50.
The penalty of 18->12 (107) vs 16->12 (82).
Wait, comparing paths:
A: 17->16 + 16->18 + 18->12 + 12->9.
B: 17->12 + 12->16 + 16->18 + 18->9.
Terms:
17->16 (261) vs 17->12 (284). A wins by 23.
16->18 (67) is in both (if direction doesn't matter).
A has 18->12 (107) + 12->9 (186) = 293.
B has 12->16 (82) + 18->9 (237) = 319.
Total A = 261 + 67 (shifted) + 293. Actually 17->16(261)+16->18(67)+18->12(107)+12->9(186) = 621.
Total B = 17->12(284)+12->16(82)+16->18(67)+18->9(237) = 670.
Path A is shorter by ~50 pixels!
Despite the zig-zag, the 12->9 connection is so much better than 18->9 that it's worth detouring back from 18 to 12.
Also 17->16 is shorter than 17->12.

So the sequence is 17 -> 16 -> 18 -> 12 -> 9.
Let's visually confirm 16->18->12.
16 is low-right. 18 is high-right. 12 is low-left (of the group).
Triangle 12-16-18.
Entering from bottom (17). Exiting to top-left (9).
17 is below.
Go to 16.
Go to 18 (top).
Go to 12 (left).
Go to 9 (top-left).
This makes sense. It uses 18 to "turn around" vertically and 12 to bridge the gap leftward.

One final option: 17->16->12->18->9.
17->16 (261).
16->12 (82).
12->18 (107).
18->9 (237).
Sum = 261+82+107+237 = 687.
This is worst.

So **17, 16, 18, 12, 9** is the winner for the cluster.

Full list:
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 16, 18, 12, 9.

Wait, 17, 16, 18, 12...
17->16 (Up). 16->18 (Up). 18->12 (Down-Left).
This creates a crossing?
Line 17->16 vs Line 18->12.
17 is (430,600). 16 is (460,340).
18 is (480,280). 12 is (380,320).
Slope 17-16 is steep positive.
Slope 18-12 is positive.
18 is above 16. 12 is left of 16.
17 is below 16.
They don't cross.
18->12 passes "above" 17->16 segment.
12->9 passes way clear.
This looks valid.

Final path:
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 16, 18, 12, 9

List:
8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 16, 18, 12, 9.

One suspicious thing: 16 to 18 to 12.
16(450,340) -> 18(480,280) -> 12(380,320).
Angle at 18 is sharp.
16 to 18 is up-right.
18 to 12 is down-left.
Backtrack?
Is 16->12->18 better?
16->12 (left). 12->18 (right-up).
Angle at 12 is sharp?
17->16->12. Angle at 16? 17 is below. 12 is left. Angle is ~90 deg. OK.
16->12->18. Angle at 12? 16 is right. 18 is right-up. Angle is acute ~45 deg. Sharp.
17->16->18. Angle at 16? 17 is below. 18 is above. Angle is 180 (straight). Excellent.
16->18->12. Angle at 18? 16 is below. 12 is left-down. Angle is ~45 deg. Sharp.
Both have a sharp turn.
But 16->18 is "on the way" from 17.
Basically 17->16->18 is a straight line.
Then we hook back 18->12.
Then 12->9 extends that hook.
This seems most natural. Run up the spine, hook back to the left.

Final decision stands.

8, 6, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 2, 19, 4, 13, 5, 20, 7, 15, 17, 16, 18, 12, 9.
