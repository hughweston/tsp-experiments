To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I will visually determine the shortest path by connecting nearest neighbors to form a loop, minimizing the total distance traveled.

Here is the step-by-step visual path:
1.  Start at a point, let's say **4** at the top left.
2.  The closest point to the east is **1**.
3.  From 1, the nearest neighbor going down is **9**.
4.  From 9, move southwest to **2**.
5.  From 2, head down to the bottom right cluster. The most logical entry is **11** or **10**. Let's go to **11**.
6.  From 11, the very close neighbors are **10** and **7**. Go to **10**, then **7**.
7.  From 7, we need to loop back towards the left. The bottom-most path goes through **13**.
8.  From 13, move left to **15**.
9.  From 15, the nearest point is **12**.
10. From 12, go up to **5**.
11. From 5, move slightly right to **14**.
12. From 14, go to **6**.
13. From 6, go up to **3**.
14. From 3, connect to the center point **8**.
15. From 8, complete the loop by returning to the area of our start. The connection from 8 back to 4 closes the loop efficiently.

Wait, let me re-evaluate the connection between 8, 2, and the start.
Let's trace again to ensure no crossing lines (a key heuristic for TSP):
- Start at **1** (top right).
- Go to **4** (top left).
- Go down to **3**.
- Go down to **6**.
- Go left to **14**.
- Go left/down to **5**.
- Go down to **12**.
- Go right to **15**.
- Go right to **13**.
- Go right to **11**.
- Go right to **10**.
- Go right to **7**.
- Go up to **9**.
- Go left to **2**.
- Go left to **8**.
- Go up to **1**? No, 8 is closer to 4 or 3 than 1. And 1 and 4 are close.

Let's try a different order that flows better:
Start **1** -> **9** -> **7** -> **10** -> **11** -> **13** -> **15** -> **12** -> **5** -> **14** -> **6** -> **3** -> **8** -> **2** (this is a long jump back) -> **1**. This leaves a big gap.

Let's try to include 8 and 2 in the middle:
Start **1** -> **4** -> **3** -> **6** -> **14** -> **5** -> **12** -> **15** -> **13** -> **11** -> **10** -> **7** -> **9** -> **2** -> **8** -> **1**.
Let's check the segment **8 -> 1**. That's a bit long.
Let's check the segment **4 -> 8**. Also long.

Let's look at the central cluster. 8 is somewhat central. 2 is right of 8.
Maybe the loop goes:
**4** -> **1** -> **9** -> **2** -> **8** ... wait, 2 to 8 is good. 8 to 3 is good.
Let's trace:
1. **1** -> **9** (Right side down)
2. **9** -> **7** (Down to bottom right corner)
3. **7** -> **10** (Small hop)
4. **10** -> **11** (Small hop left)
5. **11** -> **2** (Up and left? No, 2 is too far up. Better to go across the bottom.)
   - Alternative: **11** -> **13** (Left along bottom)
   - **13** -> **15** (Left)
   - **15** -> **12** (Left/Down)
   - **12** -> **5** (Up)
   - **5** -> **14** (Right)
   - **14** -> **6** (Right)
   - **6** -> **3** (Up)
   - **3** -> **8** (Right/Up)
   - **8** -> **2** (Right)
   - **2** -> **11**? No, we already visited 11.
   
   Let's integrate 2 and 8 better.
   Route:
   **1** -> **4** -> **3** -> **6** -> **14** -> **5** -> **12** -> **15** -> **13** -> **11** -> **10** -> **7** -> **9** -> **2** -> **8** -> (Back to 1? Or back to 4?).
   The gap between 8 and 1 or 4 is the problem.
   Actually, looking at the image, 8 is quite close to 1. 
   Distance check: 8 is closer to 1 than 2 is to 1.
   
   Let's try this flow:
   **4** -> **3** -> **6** -> **14** -> **5** -> **12** -> **15** -> **13** -> **11** -> **10** -> **7** -> **9** -> **2** -> **8** -> **1** -> **4**.
   
   This creates a perimeter tour. Let's verify the connections:
   - 4 to 3: Logical vertical step.
   - 3 to 6: Logical vertical step.
   - 6 to 14: Short hop left.
   - 14 to 5: Short hop left.
   - 5 to 12: Short hop down.
   - 12 to 15: Short hop right.
   - 15 to 13: Logical hop right.
   - 13 to 11: Long-ish hop right, but follows the "bottom edge".
   - 11 to 10: Short hop.
   - 10 to 7: Short hop.
   - 7 to 9: Up the right side.
   - 9 to 2: Diagonal left/down. This seems correct.
   - 2 to 8: Left.
   - 8 to 1: Up and right. This crosses the "middle" space.
   - 1 to 4: Left.
   
   Let's check if 2 should connect to 11 instead of 9 connecting to 2.
   If we go **9** -> **2** -> **11**, that's a big jump.
   If we go **9** -> **2** -> **8**, that's efficient.
   Where does 8 go? 8 -> 3?
   If **8 -> 3**, then we have the left cluster **3-6-14-5-12-15-13**.
   Then from 13 we go to **11-10-7-9**.
   From 9 we go to **1**.
   From 1 we go to **4**.
   From 4 we go to **8**? That crosses 3.
   
   Let's re-examine **8**. Point 8 is between 3 and 2.
   The sequence **3 -> 8 -> 2** is a very straight line. Or **2 -> 8 -> 3**.
   
   Let's try building around that spine:
   ... **6** -> **3** -> **8** -> **2** ...
   From 2, the nearest unvisited is **9** or **11**? 9 is closer.
   So **2 -> 9**.
   From **9 -> 1**.
   From **1 -> 4**.
   From **4 -> ...** we need to get to the bottom left. **4 -> 5** is far. **4 -> 14** is far.
   We probably need to enter the left cluster from the top (4 -> 3) or leave it to go to 4.
   
   Let's try spiraling or "C" shape.
   Start **1** -> **4** -> **3** -> **6** -> **14** -> **5** -> **12** -> **15** -> **13** -> **11** -> **10** -> **7** -> **9** -> **2** -> **8** -> **1**.
   This looks like the most solid "outer hull + returning through the middle" strategy, but the **8 -> 1** link is a bit long and cuts across. Is **8 -> 1** shorter than **2 -> 1**? Yes.
   Is there a way to avoid the long **8 -> 1** link?
   
   How about: **4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4**.
   Let's trace this:
   - 4 to 1: Top edge.
   - 1 to 8: Diagonal down-left.
   - 8 to 2: Right.
   - 2 to 9: Up-Right.
   - 9 to 7: Down. (Long jump).
   - 7...10...11...13...15...12...5...14...6...3 (Perimeter sweep).
   - 3 to 4.
   
   This seems plausible, but the zig-zag **1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9** feels inefficient compared to keeping 8 and 2 "inside" or just part of a sweep.
   
   Let's reconsider the simple perimeter loop:
   **1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 2** (2 is somewhat close to 11?) -> **8 -> 3** ... no 2 is far from 11.
   The gap between the right cluster (9, 2, 7, 10, 11) and the left cluster is handled best via the bottom (13-11) or the middle (8-3).
   
   Let's compare distances visually:
   Distance 11-2 vs 11-13? 11-13 looks shorter.
   Distance 2-8 vs 2-11? 2-8 is much shorter.
   Distance 8-3 vs 8-1? 8-3 is shorter.
   
   So the chain **2 - 8 - 3** is highly likely.
   
   Let's integrate **2-8-3** into a loop.
   Path: **... -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7 -> ...**
   We have ends at 9 and 7.
   Connect **7 -> 9**? Yes.
   Now we have a loop **9-2-8-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-9**.
   We are missing **1** and **4**.
   Where do they fit?
   They are at the top.
   Nearest points to 1 and 4 are 9, 8, 3.
   
   We can insert 1 and 4 between 9 and 3?
   Current segment: **9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3**.
   Modification: **9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3**? Then where do 2 and 8 go?
   Modification: **9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2**?
   Let's check connectivity:
   **7 -> 9**
   **9 -> 1** (Natural extension upward)
   **1 -> 4** (Left across top)
   **4 -> 3** (Down)
   **3 -> 6** (Down)
   **6 -> 14** ... loop around bottom ... **11 -> 10**
   **10 -> 2**? No, 10 is far from 2. 10 is near 7.
   The bottom right cluster is 11, 10, 7.
   How to connect bottom right to top/middle right?
   Option A: **11 -> 2** (Gap is large).
   Option B: **7 -> 9** (Gap is medium).
   Option C: **10 -> 2** (Gap is large).
   
   The connection **7 -> 9** is the standard "right edge".
   
   Let's try to fit 2 and 8 into the perimeter.
   If we go **7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6**, we leave 2 and 8 stranded in the middle.
   We must visit 2 and 8.
   8 is close to 3. 2 is close to 8. 2 is close to 11? No. 2 is close to 9? Sort of.
   
   Let's try looping inward.
   **1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6**... then 6 to 1? No, 6 to 3 is closest.
   
   Let's look at **6**. Its neighbors are 3, 14, 13(far), 8(medium).
   Best neighbors for 6 are **3** and **14**.
   So the sequence is almost certainly **3 - 6 - 14** (or reverse).
   
   Let's look at **14**. Neighbors: 6, 5. Sequence: **6 - 14 - 5**.
   Let's look at **5**. Neighbors: 14, 12. Sequence: **14 - 5 - 12**.
   Let's look at **12**. Neighbors: 5, 15. Sequence: **5 - 12 - 15**.
   Let's look at **15**. Neighbors: 12, 13. Sequence: **12 - 15 - 13**.
   Let's look at **13**. Neighbors: 15, 11, 6(far). Sequence: **15 - 13 - 11**.
   Let's look at **11**. Neighbors: 13, 10. Sequence: **13 - 11 - 10**.
   Let's look at **10**. Neighbors: 11, 7. Sequence: **11 - 10 - 7**.
   
   So far we have a solid chain for the bottom half:
   **3 - 6 - 14 - 5 - 12 - 15 - 13 - 11 - 10 - 7**
   
   Now we have remaining points: **1, 4, 8, 2, 9**.
   Current ends of chain: **3** and **7**.
   We need to connect 3 and 7 using the remaining points.
   
   From **7**, the nearest is **9**. So **7 - 9**.
   From **9**, nearest are **1** and **2**.
   From **3**, nearest are **4** and **8**.
   
   Let's try path A: **7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2**... then 2 to 3? 2 is not very close to 3. 8 is close to 3.
   This order puts 8 then 2. So we end at 2. We need to close 2 to 3? No, 2 to 3 is bad.
   
   Let's try path B: **7 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1**... then 1 to 3? No.
   
   Let's work backwards from **3**.
   We need to connect to **3**. The best candidate is **8** or **4**.
   If we connect **8 -> 3**, then before 8 we likely had **2**. So **2 -> 8 -> 3**.
   Now we need to connect **7** (other end of chain) to **2**.
   Chain so far: **7 ... (gap) ... 2 -> 8 -> 3**.
   Remaining points: **1, 4, 9**.
   
   We are at **7**. Go to **9**.
   From **9**, we have **1** and **4**.
   From **9**, go to **1**.
   From **1**, go to **4**.
   From **4**, we need to get to **2**. That's a huge jump across the middle.
   
   Let's rethink the 3 connection. Maybe **4 -> 3**?
   If **4 -> 3**, then before 4 was **1**. So **1 -> 4 -> 3**.
   Remaining points: **2, 8, 9**.
   We are at **7**. Go to **9**? No, 9 is far from 2/8.
   Actually **9** is fairly close to **2**.
   Let's try: **7 -> 10 -> 11... -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8**.
   Now we must close **8 -> 7**. This is a long jump.
   Or **8 -> 10/11**? No.
   
   Let's look at the **2, 8, 9, 1, 4** cluster again.
   Maybe the order is **8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4**.
   Does **4** connect to **3**? Yes.
   Does **8** connect to... **7**? No.
   Does **8** connect to... **6**? No.
   
   Wait, look at point **2**. It is somewhat isolated in the middle right.
   Best neighbors: **8** (left), **9** (top right), **11/10/7** (bottom right).
   Visually, **2** sits between **8** and **9**. Or **8** and **7**? No, 7 is too low.
   The sequence **8 -> 2 -> 9** or **9 -> 2 -> 8** seems mandatory.
   
   Let's assume **9 -> 2 -> 8**.
   From **8**, best is **3**.
   So: **9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3**.
   Then **3** starts the long bottom chain: **3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7**.
   Now we are at **7**. We need to get back to **9**.
   But we have **1** and **4** left!
   We are at **7**. Closest neighbors are 10, 9.
   If we go **7 -> 9**, we close the loop but miss 1 and 4.
   
   So **1** and **4** must be inserted.
   Can we go **7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4**?
   Then we are at **4**. We need to close to the start of the chain, which was **9**? No, start was **9**. We need to close **4 -> 9**. That's okay distance.
   But earlier we said the chain starts **9 -> 2**. So we need to connect **4** (end) to **9** (start).
   Let's check the loop:
   **9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9**.
   Let's verify the **7 -> 1** link.
   **7** is bottom right. **1** is top right. That is a VERY long jump.
   This is incorrect.
   
   The points **1, 4** must connect to **9** or **3** or **8**.
   **1** is very close to **9**.
   **4** is very close to **1**.
   **4** is somewhat close to **3**.
   
   Let's try sequence: **9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2**.
   Does this work?
   **9 -> 1**: Up. Good.
   **1 -> 4**: Left. Good.
   **4 -> 3**: Down. Good.
   **3 -> 8**: Right. Good.
   **8 -> 2**: Right. Good.
   From **2**, where do we go? We need to enter the bottom chain.
   Nearest from **2** is... **11**? It's a bit far. **7**? Far.
   If we go **2 -> 9**, we close a small loop and miss the whole bottom.
   
   Maybe the bottom chain runs differently?
   **... 10 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> ...**
   **7 -> 2** is quite a distance.
   **10 -> 2** is also far.
   **11 -> 2** is also far.
   
   Is there a point I'm missing? **2** is the pivot.
   Let's check **2 -> 9**. Good.
   Let's check **2 -> 8**. Good.
   Let's check **2 -> 7**. Long.
   Let's check **2 -> 10/11**. Long.
   
   It really seems **2** must connect to **8** and **9**.
   So the sequence is ... **8 - 2 - 9** ...
   From **9**, best is **1**.
   From **1**, best is **4**.
   From **4**, best is **3**.
   From **3**, best is **6**.
   From **6**, best is **14**.
   From **14**, best is **5**.
   From **5**, best is **12**.
   From **12**, best is **15**.
   From **15**, best is **13**.
   From **13**, best is **11**.
   From **11**, best is **10**.
   From **10**, best is **7**.
   
   Now we are at **7**.
   We need to close the loop back to the start of the sequence, which was **8**.
   So we need a link **7 -> 8**.
   Let's look at the image.
   **7** is bottom right. **8** is center.
   That is a diagonal line across empty space. It looks plausible if there are no intervening points. **2** and **10** are nearby but "behind" or "below".
   Is **7 -> 2** shorter? No.
   Is **7 -> 9** shorter? Yes, definitely.
   
   But if we connect **7 -> 9**, we break the **8-2-9** chain.
   Unless the chain is **... 7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 ...**
   Let's try:
   Start **8**.
   **8 -> 2** (Right)
   **2 -> ?**
   If we don't go to 9, where?
   Maybe **2 -> 11**? It's the closest of the bottom cluster.
   Let's compare **8 -> 11** vs **2 -> 11**. Visually similar.
   If **2 -> 11**, then **11 -> 10 -> 7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 ...**
   End at **13**. Start was **8**.
   Need **13 -> 8**.
   **13** is bottom center. **8** is center.
   This is a medium jump.
   
   Let's look at the **13 -> 11** area.
   **15 -> 13 -> 11** is standard.
   Could it be **15 -> 13 -> 8**? No.
   
   Let's look at **6**.
   Could it be **6 -> 8**?
   Neighbors of 8: 2, 3, 6?
   8 is equidistant to 3, 6, 2.
   If we use **3 -> 8 -> 6**, we create a triangle.
   Then **6 -> 14 ... loop bottom ... -> 11 -> 2 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10**?
   No, 11 to 2 is bad.
   
   Let's reconsider the **7 -> 9** link. It feels very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **9 -> 1** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **1 -> 4** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **4 -> 3** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **3 -> 6** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **6 -> 14** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **14 -> 5** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **5 -> 12** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **12 -> 15** link. Very strong.
   Let's reconsider the **15 -> 13** link. Very strong.
   
   So we have a chain **7-9-1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13**.
   We also have the pair **10, 11** and **8, 2**.
   **13** connects well to **11**. So add **11**.
   **11** connects well to **10**. So add **10**.
   **10** connects well to **7**.
   
   This makes a loop: **13-11-10-7-9-1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13**.
   BUT we missed **8** and **2**.
   
   We must insert **8** and **2** into this loop.
   Where are they located?
   **8** is near **3, 6, 2**.
   **2** is near **9, 8, 11**.
   
   Insertion candidates:
   1. Between **3** and **6**? **3 -> 8 -> 6**.
      Then where does **2** go? **8 -> 2 -> 6**? No.
      **3 -> 8 -> 2 -> ?**
      From **2**, we need to get back to the loop.
      Closest points to **2** are **9** and **11** (and 8).
      So we could break the loop at **9** or **11**.
   
   Let's try breaking at **9**:
   Old: **7 -> 9 -> 1**
   New: **7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1**?
   Check distances:
   **7 -> 2**: Long.
   **2 -> 8**: Short.
   **8 -> 9**: Medium/Long (crossing 2).
   This seems bad.
   
   Let's try breaking at **11**:
   Old: **13 -> 11 -> 10**
   New: **13 -> 8 -> 2 -> 11 -> 10**?
   **13 -> 8**: Medium.
   **8 -> 2**: Short.
   **2 -> 11**: Medium/Long.
   Possible.
   
   Let's try inserting near **3**:
   Old: **4 -> 3 -> 6**
   New: **4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6**?
   **4 -> 8**: Medium.
   **8 -> 2**: Short.
   **2 -> 3**: Medium (crossing 8). Bad.
   
   How about **4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1**?
   Old: **4 -> 3 ... 9 -> 1 -> 4**
   Let's trace:
   ... **6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14** -> ...
   From **14**, we need to close to **4**?
   **14 -> 4** is a long jump. And we missed **1**.
   Insert **1** near **4**.
   **14 -> 4 -> 1**.
   From **1**, connect to **9** (start of right chain)?
   **1 -> 9**.
   
   Let's check this full path:
   **1 -> 4 -> 14** (Wait, 4 to 14 is long. 14 to 6 is better).
   Let's go:
   **1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1**.
   
   Let's critique the links:
   - **9 -> 2**: OK.
   - **2 -> 8**: OK.
   - **8 -> 1**: Medium/Long. Crosses near 3 and 4?
   Looking at coordinates roughly:
   8 is center. 1 is top right.
   Between 8 and 1 lies nothing directly, but it's a hypotenuse.
   Is **8 -> 3** shorter than **8 -> 1**? Yes.
   Is **4 -> 1** shorter than **8 -> 1**? Yes.
   So **8 -> 1** is likely not optimal if we can route through closer nodes.
   But we need to close the loop.
   
   Alternative closure:
   Instead of **9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1**, try **9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2**.
   Now we are at **2**. We need to connect to the bottom chain starting at **7** (since we came from 9) or **11**?
   Let's assume the loop is **Bottom Chain -> Right Side -> Top -> Middle -> Bottom Chain**.
   
   Sequence:
   **13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11**.
   Now we need to close **11** to **13**. Oh, that's already connected.
   We missed **8** and **2**.
   
   We have a gap between **11** and **13**? No, they are neighbors.
   We have a gap between **6** and **3**? Neighbors.
   
   Where is the "weakest link" in the outer perimeter that lets us dive in to 8 and 2?
   Weakest links (longest edges in perimeter):
   - **11 -> 13**? No, fairly close.
   - **13 -> 15**? Close.
   - **6 -> 3**? Close.
   - **3 -> 4**? Close.
   - **4 -> 1**? Close.
   - **1 -> 9**? Close.
   - **9 -> 7**? Longish.
   - **7 -> 10**? Close.
   - **10 -> 11**? Close.
   
   So the long edges are **9 -> 7** and connections involving **14** (like **6 -> 14** is a bit of a stretch? No, looks ok. **14 -> 5** ok. **5 -> 12** ok).
   
   Wait, **6 -> 14** looks perfectly fine.
   
   Let's look at **9 -> 2 -> 7**.
   **9 -> 2** is medium.
   **2 -> 7** is long.
   **9 -> 7** is long.
   So inserting 2 between 9 and 7 is not great because 2-7 is bad.
   
   Let's look at **8**.
   **3 -> 8** is short.
   **8 -> 2** is short.
   **2 -> 9** is medium/short.
   
   This suggests a path segment: **3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9**.
   Let's see if we can build around this.
   From **9**: go to **1**? **9 -> 1**.
   From **1**: go to **4**.
   From **4**: We need to connect to the rest of the graph.
   The rest starts at **6** (since we did 3->8).
   So we need **4 -> 6**.
   Is **4 -> 6** good?
   4 is top left. 6 is middle left (below 3).
   Distance 4-6 is longer than 4-3 and 3-6. But since we used 3 for 8, we bypassed the 4-3-6 line.
   This looks like a valid detour: **... 4 -> 6 ...** ?
   Actually, **4 -> 14** is even further.
   **4 -> 5** is further.
   
   Maybe the order is **6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8**.
   Now we are at **8**. We need to connect to the bottom cluster.
   We have not visited **14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7**.
   From **8**, closest unvisited is... **14**? No. **13**? Maybe. **11**?
   Visually, **8** is quite central. It might connect to **14**?
   Distance 8-14 looks far.
   
   Let's reconsider the standard TSP hull strategy.
   Outer loop: **4-1-9-7-10-11-13-15-12-5-14-6-3-4**.
   Points inside: **8, 2**.
   8 is close to the 3-6 edge and 4-3 edge.
   2 is close to the 9-7 edge? No, 2 is high up. 2 is close to 9.
   2 is close to 8.
   
   Insert **8, 2** into the loop.
   Best place to insert **2** is attached to **9**.
   So **... 1 -> 9 -> 2 ...**
   Now from **2**, we must go to **8**. **2 -> 8**.
   From **8**, we must return to the loop.
   The loop continues at **7**. **8 -> 7** is far.
   The loop continues at **3**. **8 -> 3** is close.
   So: **... 1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3 ...**
   Let's trace this:
   **1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3**.
   From **3**, continue loop: **3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12 -> 15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7**.
   From **7**, close loop to **1**.
   **7 -> 1**.
   This is the long diagonal again. We want to avoid **7 -> 1**.
   
   Can we reverse the section?
   Loop: **... 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 ...**
   Now close **4** to **7**? Even longer.
   
   We need the ends of the loop to be close.
   The gap is clearly around **7, 9, 1** or **2, 8**.
   
   Let's try:
   **4 -> 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2**.
   Now close **2** to **4**.
   Distance **2 -> 4** is across the whole top middle. Long.
   
   Let's try:
   **15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12**.
   Close **12 -> 15**. Good.
   Check links:
   **7 -> 2**: Long.
   **4 -> 8**: Medium.
   **8 -> 3**: Short.
   
   Let's try:
   **15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12**.
   Close **12 -> 15**. Good.
   Check links:
   **9 -> 2**: Good.
   **2 -> 8**: Good.
   **8 -> 1**: Medium/Long.
   **4 -> 3**: Good.
   
   Let's try modifying the top:
   **... 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 ...**
   From **1**, where to?
   We need to go to **6**? No, we used 3.
   We need to go to **14**? Far.
   
   Let's look at **6**.
   **6** connects to **3** and **14**.
   Sequence **3-6-14** is extremely robust.
   
   Let's look at **4**.
   **4** connects to **1** and **3**.
   Sequence **1-4-3** is very robust.
   
   Let's combine: **1-4-3-6-14**.
   Add the bottom: **14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7**.
   Now we have chain **1...7**.
   Remaining: **9, 2, 8**.
   We need to bridge **7** to **1**.
   Via **9, 2, 8**.
   
   **7 -> 9** is good.
   Now we have **9** and need to get to **1**.
   Path: **9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1**?
   As discussed, **8 -> 1** is the weak link here.
   
   Alternative: **7 -> 10 -> 2**? No.
   Alternative: **7 -> 2**? No.
   
   Is there a better way to route **8**?
   Maybe **4-8-3**?
   Path: **1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 14 ... -> 7 -> 1**.
   **7->1** is bad.
   
   Path: **1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 11 -> 2 -> 8 -> 13**?
   **11 -> 2**: Bad.
   **8 -> 13**: Bad.
   
   Let's look at the **2-8** alignment again.
   The line **2-8** points roughly towards **6** or **14**? No, it points left, slightly down. Towards **6**.
   Could it be **2 -> 8 -> 6**?
   Then **3** is isolated.
   **4 -> 3 -> 1**?
   
   Let's try **8** connecting to **6**:
   **... 9 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 14 ...**
   Then **3**? **3** is above **6**.
   Maybe **3 -> 4 -> 1 ...**
   How to connect **14** chain back to **3**?
   **... 12 -> 5 -> 3**? No. **5 -> 3** is crossing 14/6.
   
   Let's try **8** connecting to **14**? No.
   
   Let's go back to the most promising loop and optimize the weak link.
   Loop: **1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-9-2-8-1**.
   Weak link: **8 -> 1**.
   Can we rearrange **1, 4, 3, 8, 2, 9**?
   We have entry from **6** (bottom chain end) and exit to **7** (bottom chain start, reversed).
   Wait, let's fix the bottom chain: **6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7**.
   Ends are **6** and **7**.
   We need to path **6 ... 7** through the top points.
   Points: **3, 4, 1, 9, 2, 8**.
   
   Start at **6**. Nearest is **3**.
   **6 -> 3**.
   From **3**, nearest are **4, 8**.
   
   Option A: **3 -> 4**.
   Then **4 -> 1**.
   Then **1 -> 9**.
   Then **9 -> 2**.
   Then **2 -> 8**.
   Then **8 -> 7**. (Long jump).
   
   Option B: **3 -> 8**.
   Then **8 -> 2**.
   Then **2 -> 9**.
   Then **9 -> 1**.
   Then **1 -> 4**.
   Then **4 -> 7**. (Extremely long jump).
   
   Option C: **3 -> 8**.
   Then **8 -> 4**? (Crosses).
   
   Option D: Work backwards from **7**.
   **7 -> 9** (Short).
   **9 -> 2** (Short/Med).
   **2 -> 8** (Short).
   **8 -> 3** (Short).
   **3 -> 4** (Short).
   **4 -> 1** (Short).
   Now connect **1** to **6**?
   **1** is top right. **6** is mid left.
   This cuts across everything.
   
   What if **8** connects to **6**?
   **6 -> 8** (Med).
   **8 -> 2** (Short).
   **2 -> 9** (Short).
   **9 -> 1** (Short).
   **1 -> 4** (Short).
   **4 -> 3** (Short).
   **3 -> ...** connect to bottom chain.
   But we started at **6** which is in the bottom chain.
   This isolates **3**.
   
   Ah, look at **3**. It's a leaf almost. Only close to **4, 6, 8**.
   So **3** MUST be between two of these.
   Combinations:
   **4-3-6**: Standard.
   **4-3-8**: Possible.
   **6-3-8**: Possible.
   
   If **4-3-6**:
   We are left with **8** to place.
   **8** must connect to **2**.
   So we have a chunk **...-2-8-?**
   If **8** connects to **6**, we break **3-6**. So **4-3** and **6-8-2**.
   Now we need to connect **3** and **4** to the rest.
   And **2** to the rest.
   Rest is **1, 9, 7...14**.
   Path: **14...7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 (break) -> 8 -> 2**.
   We need to close **2 -> 14**? Far.
   Or reverse: **14... -> 6 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3**.
   Close **3 -> 5**? No.
   
   Let's check the **8 -> 1** connection again visually.
   Draw a line from **8** to **1**.
   It passes right of **4**. It's unobstructed. Distance is maybe 3 units (relative).
   Compare to **2 -> 7** (3 units).
   Compare to **4 -> 6** (2.5 units).
   Compare to **11 -> 2** (3 units).
   
   The path **1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-9-2-8-1** seems to have only one "medium-long" leg: **8 -> 1**.
   Let's check if we can improve **8 -> 1**.
   Can we route **8 -> 4**? Similar distance.
   Can we route **2 -> 1**? Longer than 8-1.
   Can we route **9 -> 4**? Longer than 1-4.
   
   Is there a different topology?
   Maybe **15-12-5-14-6-8-3-4-1-9-2-11-13...**
   Check **2 -> 11**.
   Distance 2-11 seems larger than 8-1.
   Let's measure on screen.
   8 to 1: dx large, dy medium.
   2 to 11: dx small, dy large.
   Visually, 8-1 looks longer than 2-11.
   Wait, 2 is high, 11 is low.
   8 is high-mid, 1 is top.
   8 is closer to 1 than 2 is to 11.
   
   Let's look at **2 -> 10**. 10 is right of 11.
   2 is right side.
   2 is closer to 10/7 than 11.
   Distance **2 -> 7**:
   2 is at y=~middle. 7 is y=bottom.
   8 -> 1 is y=mid to y=top.
   Top gap looks smaller than bottom gap.
   
   Therefore **8 -> 1** is likely better than **2 -> 7** or **2 -> 10**.
   
   Let's re-verify the **8 -> 1** path order.
   **1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-9-2-8-1**.
   Let's try to rotate the 2-8-9 block.
   **... 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1 ...**
   **7 -> 2** is long.
   
   **... 7 -> 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 ...**
   **9 -> 8**: Crosses 2? No, 8 is left of 2. 9 is top right. 9-8 goes diagonal. 2 is right of 8. It's okay.
   **2 -> 1**: 2 is lower than 9. 1 is higher than 9. 2-1 is longer than 9-1.
   
   **... 7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 ...**
   **1 -> 2**: Down.
   **2 -> 8**: Left.
   **8 -> 4**: Up Left.
   **4 -> 3**: Down.
   This looks promising.
   Let's check **8 -> 4**.
   8 is central. 4 is top left.
   It's a diagonal.
   Is **8 -> 4** better than **8 -> 1**?
   1 is top right-ish. 4 is top left-ish.
   8 is more central-right? No, 8 is central-left (relative to 1/9/2).
   Let's look at x-coordinates.
   Left to Right: 5, 12, 14, 4, 15, 6, 3, 13, 8, 11, 2, 10, 1, 7, 9. (Rough guess).
   4 is definitely left of 1.
   8 is definitely right of 6/3.
   3 is right of 4.
   So 8 is right of 4.
   1 is right of 8.
   So 8 is between 4 and 1 horizontally.
   Vertically: 4(top), 1(top), 3(mid-high), 8(mid), 6(mid-low).
   So 8 is below 4 and 1.
   Triangle 4-1-8.
   Side 4-1 is horizontal-ish.
   Side 8-4 and 8-1 are diagonals.
   Usually, 4-1 is the shortest edge of that triangle.
   So we should keep 4-1 connected.
   This supports the **...4-1-8...** or **...8-1-4...** structure being suboptimal compared to **...4-1...** and connecting 8 elsewhere.
   
   But 8 has to connect somewhere.
   It connects to 2 (right) and 3 (left).
   This forms **3-8-2**.
   So we have chain **...6-3-8-2-9...**
   Then **9 -> 1**.
   Then **1 -> 4**.
   Then **4** connects to start of loop **6**? Or to end?
   We have **6-3-8-2-9-1-4**.
   We need to close **4 -> 6**.
   Distance 4-6 is the leg of the triangle 4-3-6.
   We replaced legs 4-3 and 3-6 with 4-6?
   Triangle inequality says 4-6 < 4-3 + 3-6.
   So **4-6** is a shortcut.
   But we added **3-8-2-9-1**. That's a huge detour.
   
   Wait, the tour must visit ALL points.
   My previous loop visited all: **1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-9-2-8-1**.
   The cost was adding **8-1**.
   
   Alternative loop visiting all: **4-1-9-2-8-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-?**
   Close **7 -> 4**. Long diagonal.
   
   Alternative: **4-3-8-2-9-1-?**
   Close **1 -> 4**. (Already connected in loop logic).
   Where is the rest? **6-14...7**.
   Connect **3** to **6**? No, we went 4-3-8.
   So **6** is orphaned.
   Connect **6** to **8**? **4-3-6-8**?
   **3 -> 6** (Down). **6 -> 8** (Right).
   **8 -> 2** (Right). **2 -> 9** (Up). **9 -> 1** (Left). **1 -> 4** (Left).
   This creates loop **4-3-6-8-2-9-1-4**.
   Points included: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9.
   Points excluded: 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7.
   We need to merge these loops.
   Best merge spot?
   **6** connects to **14**.
   **2** connects to **7, 10, 11**? No, weak connections.
   **9** connects to **7**.
   
   Merge at **9-7**:
   Break **2-9** or **9-1**.
   Insert **7-10-11-13-15-12-5-14**.
   We need to connect end **14** back.
   If we insert at **9-1**: **9 -> 7...14 -> 1**.
   **9 -> 7** is OK. **14 -> 1** is terrible.
   
   Merge at **6**:
   Break **6-8**.
   Insert **6 -> 14...7 -> 8**.
   **6 -> 14** OK.
   **7 -> 8** is the long diagonal we saw earlier.
   
   Merge at **6** (other side):
   Break **3-6**.
   Insert **3 -> 14...7 -> 6**.
   **3 -> 14** is crossing 6. Bad.
   
   Merge at **9-2**:
   Break **9-2**.
   Insert **9 -> 7...14 -> 2**.
   **9 -> 7** OK.
   **14 -> 2** Very bad.
   
   Let's check **7 -> 8** again.
   Is there any node between 7 and 8? **10, 11** are below. **2** is right.
   **7 -> 8** is a clean shot through the space.
   Is it shorter than **8 -> 1**?
   7 is bottom right. 8 is center.
   1 is top right. 8 is center.
   1 is closer to 8.
   So the loop with **8-1** is better than **7-8**.
   
   So the loop **1-4-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7-9-2-8-1** seems the best candidate.
   
   Let's double check **2 -> 11**.
   Maybe **...9 -> 2 -> 11 -> 10 -> 7...**?
   Then we are left with **...13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 1 -> 4**.
   We need to close **4 -> 9**.
   Or **4 -> 7** (if we reversed).
   Let's trace: **4-1-8-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-2-9-7-10**?
   No, **7, 10** must be together. **11, 10** together.
   **13-11-10-7**.
   So from **7** or **10** or **11** we go to **2**.
   **7 -> 2**? Long.
   **10 -> 2**? Medium. (10 is rightmost of bottom cluster).
   **11 -> 2**? Medium/Long.
   **9 -> 2** is Short.
   
   So **2** should connect to **9**.
   
   Final sanity check on the path:
   **1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8** ... back to 1.
   
   Segments:
   1-4: Short
   4-3: Short
   3-6: Short
   6-14: Short
   14-5: Short
   5-12: Short
   12-15: Short
   15-13: Short
   13-11: Medium (Bottom edge)
   11-10: Short
   10-7: Short
   7-9: Medium (Right edge)
   9-2: Short
   2-8: Short
   8-1: Medium/Long (Closing link)
   
   Can we improve **8-1**?
   Is **8** closer to **4**?
   Visually, **8** is slightly closer to **4** than **1**.
   Change: **1-9-2-8-4-3...**
   Then close **...7-1**.
   **7-1** is definitely longer than **8-1**.
   
   Is **8** closer to **3**? Yes.
   Change: **...6-3-8-2-9-1-4**.
   Close **4-6**.
   **4-6** is longer than **4-3**.
   Is **4-6** longer than **8-1**?
   4-6 vs 8-1.
   4 is (10, 90). 6 is (20, 30). Dist ~60.
   8 is (50, 50). 1 is (60, 90). Dist ~40.
   So **8-1** is shorter than **4-6**.
   
   Conclusion: The sequence ending in **8-1** is better.
   
   Let's verify the starting point logic.
   "You can start from any point".
   I will provide the list starting from 1 for clarity, or following the example's convention of starting at 1 if present.
   
   Proposed List: 1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8
   
   Let's check if reversing the list is better? No, undirected graph.
   
   Let's check if starting elsewhere makes the "weak link" obvious.
   List: 8, 1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2.
   Connections:
   8-1: Weakest.
   1-4: Strong.
   4-3: Strong.
   3-6: Strong.
   6-14: Strong.
   14-5: Strong.
   5-12: Strong.
   12-15: Strong.
   15-13: Strong.
   13-11: Medium.
   11-10: Strong.
   10-7: Strong.
   7-9: Medium.
   9-2: Strong.
   2-8: Strong.
   
   This seems to be the global minimum.
   
   Wait, I should double check **13-11**.
   Could it be **15-11-13**? No, 13 is left of 11. 15 is left of 13.
   Sequence **15-13-11** is correct spatially.
   
   Could it be **5-14-12**?
   5 is (5, 30). 14 is (10, 25). 12 is (5, 10).
   5-14 is close. 14-12?
   14 is x=10, 12 is x=5. 5 is x=5.
   14 is between 5 and 6? No, 14 is below 5?
   Let's look closely at the crop.
   Crop 4 (bottom left):
   5 is top-left dot.
   14 is to its right.
   12 is below 5.
   15 is right of 12.
   13 is far right.
   So **5 -> 14** (Right).
   From **14**, nearest is **6** (Right/Up).
   Wait, my previous chain was **6-14-5-12**.
   **6 -> 14**. OK.
   **14 -> 5**. OK.
   **5 -> 12**. Down. OK.
   **12 -> 15**. Right. OK.
   **15 -> 13**. Right. OK.
   This looks perfect.
   
   One minor check: **14 -> 12**?
   Triangle 5-14-12.
   5 is (0, 1). 14 is (1, 0.5). 12 is (0, 0). (Relative).
   14 is further from 12 than 5 is from 12.
   So **14-5-12** is better than **5-14-12**.
   
   Final sequence check:
   1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8
   
   Let's confirm point labels.
   Top row: 4, 1.
   Right side: 9.
   Mid-Right: 2.
   Center: 8.
   Mid-Left: 3, 6.
   Bottom-Left cluster: 5, 14, 12, 15.
   Bottom-Center: 13.
   Bottom-Right cluster: 11, 10, 7.
   
   Is **11** part of the cluster 10/7?
   11 is left of 10. 10 is left of 7.
   Distances: 11-10 is short. 10-7 is short.
   13-11 is medium.
   Seems correct.
   
   Is **2** part of 9?
   2 is below-left of 9.
   2 is right of 8.
   Sequence **9-2-8** is logical zigzag.
   
   Is **8** part of 1?
   8-1 is the closing loop.
   
   Are there any crossed lines?
   1-4 (Top horiz)
   4-3 (Left vert)
   3-6 (Left vert)
   6-14 (Diag down-left)
   14-5 (Left)
   5-12 (Down)
   12-15 (Right)
   15-13 (Right)
   13-11 (Right)
   11-10 (Right)
   10-7 (Right)
   7-9 (Up)
   9-2 (Down-Left)
   2-8 (Left)
   8-1 (Up-Right)
   
   Does 8-1 cross anything?
   It goes from center to top-right.
   The only other lines near center/top-right are 4-3 (far left), 1-4 (top), 9-2 (far right).
   The line 8-1 passes through the empty space between 2 and 3.
   It does not cross 4-3.
   It does not cross 9-2.
   It does not cross 2-8.
   It does not cross 1-9. (1 is top right, 9 is mid right. 1-9 is right edge).
   Wait, 8-1 and 1-9 meet at 1.
   Does 8-1 cross 2-9?
   8 is (50,50). 1 is (60, 90). Line: y = 4x - 150.
   2 is (70, 40). 9 is (80, 60).
   The segment 2-9 is entirely to the right of 8-1.
   No crossing.
   
   Does 8-1 cross 7-9?
   7 is (80, 10). 9 is (80, 60).
   Entirely to the right.
   
   Does 8-1 cross 3-8?
   Meets at 8.
   
   It seems valid. The tour is simple (non-self-intersecting).
   
   Final order:
   1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8
   
   Wait, example format: "1, 5, 3...".
   I'll stick to this order.

   Alternative start for cleaner reading?
   Maybe start at 12 (bottom left corner)?
   12, 5, 14, 6, 3, 4, 1, 8, 2, 9, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15.
   Let's check the **1 -> 8** link again.
   My previous was **8->1**. Here **1->8**. Same link.
   Check **15 -> 12**. Same link.
   
   Let's verify the **1 -> 8** vs **1 -> 9**.
   Previous: **...2-8-1-4...** (Implies 1-4, 1-8).
   Loop: **1-8-2-9-7-10-11-13-15-12-5-14-6-3-4-1**.
   Links at 1: **4-1** and **8-1**.
   This skips **1-9**.
   Is **1-9** shorter than **1-8**?
   1 is top right. 9 is mid right. 8 is center.
   1 and 9 are aligned vertically on the right.
   1 and 8 are diagonal.
   Visually, **1-9** is shorter than **1-8**.
   
   If **1-9** is used, we drop **1-8**.
   Connections at 1: **4-1** and **1-9**.
   Connections at 9: **1-9** and **9-2**.
   Connections at 2: **9-2** and **2-8**.
   Connections at 8: **2-8** and **8-3**?
   
   Let's trace this path:
   **4-1-9-2-8-3-6-14-5-12-15-13-11-10-7...**
   Now we have end **7**.
   Start **4**.
   Close **7 -> 4**.
   This is the huge diagonal.
   
   So we trade:
   Path A: Uses **1-8** (Med) and **7-9** (Med). Saves **7-4** (Huge).
   Path B: Uses **1-9** (Short) and **7-4** (Huge).
   
   Path A is clearly better because it avoids the massive cross-graph jump **7-4**.
   The "cost" is using **1-8** instead of **1-9**, and using **7-9** (which is decent).
   Wait, if we use **1-8**, do we lose **1-9**?
   Yes, we go **9-2-8-1-4**. 9 connects to 7.
   So **7-9**.
   Is **7-9** good? Yes, they are right-edge neighbors.
   
   So Path A uses: **4-1**, **1-8**, **8-2**, **2-9**, **9-7**.
   This looks like a slight "crimp" at the top right:
   Instead of the smooth **4-1-9-2-8**, we do **4-1-8-2-9**.
   Actually **4-1** is top. **1-8** goes in. **8-2** goes right. **2-9** goes up-right. **9-7** goes down.
   This backtracks a bit vertically (up to 1, down to 8, up to 9, down to 7).
   But it maintains connectivity.
   
   The alternative is having a break somewhere else.
   What if we connect **8** to **3**?
   **...4-1-9-2-8-3-6...**
   Close **...7-4**. Still bad.
   
   How about **...4-3-8-2-9-1-?**
   Close **1 -> 7**. Still bad (diagonal 1 to 7).
   
   It seems unavoidable to have one slightly longer internal link to avoid the massive return trip.
   The link **8-1** seems to be that necessary bridge.
   Or **8-4**?
   Distance 8-4 vs 8-1.
   8 is (50, 50). 4 is (10, 90). 1 is (60, 90).
   8-4: dx=40, dy=40. Hyp=56.
   8-1: dx=10, dy=40. Hyp=41.
   **8-1** is significantly shorter.
   
   So **8-1** is the winner.
   
   List: 1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8.

   One more check.
   Does **9** connect to **10**?
   9 is (80, 60). 10 is (70, 10).
   7 is (80, 10).
   9 is closer to 7 (vertical drop) than 10 (diagonal).
   Also 7 is between 9 and 10 in x-coord roughly.
   So **9-7-10** is better than **9-10**.
   My path has **7-9**. Correct.

   Does **13** connect to **10**?
   13 is (40, 5). 11 is (60, 5). 10 is (70, 10).
   13-11-10 is the line.
   My path has **13-11-10**. Correct.
   
   Final result seems robust.

   Start point: 1.
   Direction: 1 -> 4...
   1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8

   Double check for any missing points.
   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.
   All 15 present.

   Ready to write output.

   Format: "1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8"

   Let's re-read the start point flexibility. "You can start from any point".
   I will start from 1.

   Wait, let's look at 14 and 6 again.
   Is 14 closer to 3 than 6?
   3 is (20, 50).
   6 is (20, 30).
   14 is (10, 25).
   Dist 3-14: dx 10, dy 25. Hyp ~27.
   Dist 3-6: dx 0, dy 20. Hyp 20.
   Dist 6-14: dx 10, dy 5. Hyp ~11.
   So 3-6-14 is much better (20+11=31) than 3-14 (27).
   Correct.

   Let's look at 5 and 14.
   5 is (5, 30). 14 is (10, 25).
   Dist ~7.
   5 and 6?
   5 (5, 30), 6 (20, 30). Dist 15.
   14 (10, 25), 6 (20, 30). Dist 11.
   So 6-14-5 is better (11+7=18) than 6-5-14 (15+7=22).
   Correct.

   Let's look at 5 and 12.
   5 (5, 30). 12 (5, 10). Dist 20.
   14 (10, 25). 12 (5, 10). Dist ~16.
   Wait.
   Path: 14 -> 5 -> 12. Cost: 7 + 20 = 27.
   Path: 5 -> 14 -> 12. Cost: 7 + 16 = 23.
   
   Uh oh. **5 -> 14 -> 12** is better locally?
   Previous path: **...6 -> 14 -> 5 -> 12...**
   Cost: 6-14 (11) + 14-5 (7) + 5-12 (20) = 38.
   Alternative: **...6 -> 5 -> 14 -> 12...**
   Cost: 6-5 (15) + 5-14 (7) + 14-12 (16) = 38.
   It's a tie?
   Let's check visual again.
   5 is left of 14. 6 is right of 14.
   Sequence 6-14-5 is a line. 6 is (20,30), 14 is (10,25), 5 is (5,30).
   14 is below the 6-5 line.
   Going 6-5-14 is a zig zag. 6-14-5 is smoother.
   Also 14 is closer to 12?
   14 is (10, 25). 12 is (5, 10). dx=5, dy=15. Hyp=15.8.
   5 is (5, 30). 12 is (5, 10). dx=0, dy=20. Hyp=20.
   So 14 is closer to 12.
   However, 6 is much closer to 14 (11) than to 5 (15).
   Let's re-sum.
   Path A (mine): 6-14(11) + 14-5(7) + 5-12(20) = 38.
   Path B (alt): 6-5(15) + 5-14(7) + 14-12(15.8) = 37.8.
   Very close.
   But wait, where does 12 go? To 15.
   15 is (15, 8).
   12 is (5, 10).
   Dist 12-15 = 10.
   Does the order matter for 15?
   If we arrive at 12, we go to 15.
   
   Is there a connection **14 -> 15**?
   14 (10, 25). 15 (15, 8). dx=5, dy=17. Hyp=17.7.
   Compare to **14-12** (15.8) + **12-15** (10) = 25.8.
   Direct 14-15 is 17.7.
   So **14 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5**?
   Cost: 6-14(11) + 14-15(17.7) + 15-12(10) + 12-5(20) = 58.7.
   vs 6-14-5-12-15: 11+7+20+10 = 48.
   So standard loop is better.
   
   Back to **6-14-5-12** vs **6-5-14-12**.
   Visual check.
   6->14 is natural.
   14->5 is a sharp turn back?
   6 is x=20. 14 is x=10. 5 is x=5.
   No, it's a progression leftward.
   6 -> 14 -> 5 is Left-Down, then Left-Up.
   6 -> 5 -> 14 is Left, then Right-Down. This is a backtrack in X.
   Traveling Salesman generally avoids backtracks.
   So **6-14-5** is geometrically superior for maintaining the sweep.
   
   So stick with **6-14-5-12**.
   
   Final list confirmed.
   1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8

   One detail: "1, 5, 3..." example uses spaces. I will use "1, 4, 3...".
   Wait, is 13-15-12 order better?
   ...11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 5 -> 14 -> 6...
   13 is (40, 5). 15 is (15, 8). 12 is (5, 10).
   It flows Right to Left smoothly.
   Yes, this is my order reversed on the bottom.
   My order: ...6-14-5-12-15-13-11...
   This flows Left to Right.
   This is consistent.

   Okay, I'm confident.

   Result: 1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8

   Another thought: 1-9-7... order.
   1-9-2-8 is not what I chose. I chose 1-4... which ends with ...2-8-1.
   This is equivalent to ...8-1-4-3...
   In the list 1, 4... it implies the edge 8-1 closes the loop.
   In the list 1, 9... it implies edge 1-9 starts, and something closes to 1.
   My loop is defined by adjacencies.
   Adj(1) = {8, 4}.
   Adj(4) = {1, 3}.
   Adj(3) = {4, 6}.
   Adj(6) = {3, 14}.
   ...
   Adj(8) = {2, 1}.
   
   This matches my derivation.

   Final check on 10, 11 order.
   ...13, 11, 10, 7...
   13 is left. 11 is mid. 10 is right. 7 is far right.
   Flow is Left -> Right.
   Correct.

   Final check on 12, 15 order.
   ...5, 12, 15, 13...
   5 is top. 12 is bottom-left. 15 is bottom-right. 13 is far right.
   Flow is Down -> Right -> Right.
   Correct.

   Final check on 2, 8, 9.
   ...7, 9, 2, 8, 1...
   7 (bottom right) -> 9 (top right). Up.
   9 -> 2 (mid right). Down-Left.
   2 -> 8 (center). Left.
   8 -> 1 (top right). Up-Right.
   This looks a bit zig-zaggy.
   Is ...7-9-1-8-2...?
   7-9 (Up).
   9-1 (Up).
   1-8 (Down-Left).
   8-2 (Right). Backtrack?
   2 -> 4? (Long).
   
   My chosen path **9-2-8-1** minimizes long jumps, keeping everything relatively local, except the unavoidable closure. The closure **8-1** is the best of the bad options.

   Answer is ready.

   1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8

   Re-verify 14 and 5 position.
   5 is (x=5, y=30). 14 is (x=10, y=25).
   6 is (x=20, y=30).
   Path 6 -> 14 -> 5.
   x: 20 -> 10 -> 5. Monotonic.
   y: 30 -> 25 -> 30. Dip.
   Path 6 -> 5 -> 14.
   x: 20 -> 5 -> 10. Backtrack.
   y: 30 -> 30 -> 25. Flat then down.
   Monotonic X is usually better for TSP in a sweep.
   6, 14, 5 is correct.

   Final Answer construction.

   1, 4, 3, 6, 14, 5, 12, 15, 13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 2, 8
