To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I'll visually trace the shortest path connecting all the numbered points. I will look for clusters and obvious nearest-neighbor connections to form a continuous loop without crossing lines.

Here is the step-by-step path I have determined:

1.  Starting at the top right, there is a tight cluster: **1, 16, 9**.
2.  From **9**, the logical move is to the far right point: **2**.
3.  From **2**, move inwards towards **7**.
4.  From **7**, go down to **12**.
5.  Then move left to **21**.
6.  Continue down and left to **10**.
7.  From **10**, the path naturally flows down to **20**.
8.  Then to the leftmost bottom point: **4**.
9.  Move slightly up and left to **5**.
10. Then up to **14**.
11. From **14**, move left to **15**.
12. Continue up the left edge to **24**.
13. Then further up to **13**.
14. Move inwards/up to **23**.
15. Continue up to the top left corner: **22**.
16. Move down and right to **6**.
17. Then down to **19**.
18. Move right to **18**.
19. Then right again to **17**.
20. Move slightly up and right to **8**.
21. Move up to **3**.
22. Go significantly right to **11**.
23. Move up to **25**.
24. From **25**, the loop closes back to our starting cluster (1).

So, the optimal tour order is:

**1, 16, 9, 2, 7, 12, 21, 10, 20, 4, 5, 14, 15, 24, 13, 23, 22, 6, 19, 18, 17, 8, 3, 11, 25**
