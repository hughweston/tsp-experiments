To find the shortest tour for this Traveling Salesman Problem instance, I will trace the path by connecting each point to its nearest unvisited neighbor, creating a logical loop.

Here is the step-by-step visual path:

1.  Let's start at the far right, point **18**.
2.  Moving downwards, the closest point is **1**.
3.  Continuing down the right edge, go to **9**.
4.  Then down to the bottom right corner at **13**.
5.  Moving leftwards along the bottom section, the next nearest point is **11**.
6.  Continuing left along the bottom, reach **4**.
7.  Slightly upwards and left is **14**.
8.  From 14, jump down and left to **12**.
9.  Right next to it is **3**.
10. Further left and down is **15**.
11. To the left is **7**.
12. At the far bottom-left corner is **8**.
13. Moving up from the corner, go to **2**.
14. Now moving into the upper-left cluster, head to **5** (or potentially 10, but 5 seems better to bridge the gap). Actually, looking at the layout, from 2, the logical next step is up towards the top-left group. Let's go **2 -> 10**.
15. From 10, go to the nearby **6**.
16. Then slightly up to **17**.
17. Then down and right to **20**.
18. From 20, **5** is the natural bridge to the center.
19. From 5, move towards the center to **19**.
20. From 19, go to **16**.
21. From 16, the loop closes back towards the right side (where 1, 9, 18 are), specifically connecting nicely back towards 1 or 18. Let's re-verify the right-side connections.

Let's refine the loop to ensure minimal crossing:
**18 -> 1 -> 9 -> 13 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14 -> 16 -> 19 -> 5 -> 20 -> 17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 7 -> 15 -> 3 -> 12 -> (back to 14/16 area?)** No, let's try a continuous perimeter sweep.

**Revised Path (Perimeter Sweep Strategy):**
Start top-right: **18**
Go down: **1**
Go down: **9**
Go down: **13**
Go left: **11**
Go left: **4**
Go up/left: **14**
Go down/left: **12**
Go left: **3**
Go down/left: **15**
Go left: **7**
Go left: **8**
Go up/right: **2**
Go up: **10**
Go up/left: **6**
Go up: **17**
Go down/right: **20**
Go down/right: **5**
Go right: **19**
Go right: **16**
From 16, complete the loop back to **18**? No, 16 is far from 18.

Let's look at the central cluster again. The points 16, 19, 5 are somewhat central.
Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep starting from the top-left:
**17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 7 -> 15 -> 3 -> 12 -> 4 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18**.
Now we need to pick up the internal points on the way back or integrate them.
The points remaining are **16, 14, 19, 5, 20**.

Let's try to weave them in:
**17 -> 20 -> 5 -> 19 -> 16 -> 14 -> 12 -> 3 -> 15 -> 7 -> 8 -> 2 -> 10 -> 6** (This creates a knot in the top left).

Let's try again, looking for nearest neighbors strictly:
Start at **8** (bottom left corner).
8 -> 7
7 -> 15
15 -> 3
3 -> 12
12 -> 4 (gap is large, maybe 12->14?) Let's try 12->14.
14 -> 4
4 -> 11
11 -> 13
13 -> 9
9 -> 1
1 -> 18
(Now curve back left)
18 -> 16 (long jump). Maybe 1 -> 16? Or 18 -> 16?
Let's look at 16's neighbors. 16 is close to 19 and 14 and 1.
Let's route: ... -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16 -> 19 -> 5 -> 20 -> 17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8...
This leaves out a few connections or makes long jumps.

Let's try this optimal looking order:
1.  **17**
2.  **6**
3.  **10**
4.  **2**
5.  **8**
6.  **7**
7.  **15**
8.  **3**
9.  **12**
10. **14**
11. **4**
12. **11**
13. **13**
14. **9**
15. **1**
16. **18**
17. **16** (Connecting the far right back to center)
18. **19**
19. **5**
20. **20**
(And 20 connects back to 17 to close the loop).

Let's check the distances on that return path.
20 -> 17 is very short. Good.
5 -> 20 is short. Good.
19 -> 5 is short. Good.
16 -> 19 is short. Good.
18 -> 16 is a bit long, but likely the best way to bridge the right cluster to the center. The alternative is 1 -> 16, but 1 is closer to 9 and 18.
Let's re-evaluate the right side.
...11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18?
Is there a better way?
11 -> 16 -> 18 -> 1 -> 9 -> 13? No, 11 to 16 is far.
Maybe 14 -> 16?
...12 -> 3 -> 15 -> 7 -> 8 -> 2 -> 10 -> 6 -> 17 -> 20 -> 5 -> 19 -> 16 -> 18 -> 1 -> 9 -> 13 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14 -> 12...
Wait, if I go 16 -> 18, I have to come back from the bottom right (13/11) to the middle (14/12).
Let's check the connection 4 -> 14. That is close.
Let's check 12 -> 14. That is close.
So 12 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16 -> 19 -> 5... this seems very plausible.

Let's trace that full loop:
Start **17**.
17 -> 6 (close)
6 -> 10 (close)
10 -> 2 (medium)
2 -> 8 (medium-long, but 2 is isolated)
8 -> 7 (close)
7 -> 15 (close)
15 -> 3 (close)
3 -> 12 (close)
12 -> 14 (close)
14 -> 4 (close)
4 -> 11 (close)
11 -> 13 (medium)
13 -> 9 (close)
9 -> 1 (close)
1 -> 18 (close)
18 -> 16 (long, but necessary bridge)
16 -> 19 (close)
19 -> 5 (close)
5 -> 20 (close)
20 -> 17 (close)

This path covers all points and looks very optimal with no crossing lines.

**Final Path:**
17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

Let's just double check the 18->16 vs 1->16 link.
1 is lower than 18. 16 is lower than 18. 1 and 16 are reasonably close horizontally.
18 is high up.
Actually looking at the coordinates, 1 and 16 seem closer than 18 and 16.
Let's try swapping the end of the right side loop.
Instead of ...9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16...
Try ...9 -> 13 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14... (wait, need to include the right side top).
Try going up the right side: ...11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18.
From 18, where to go? 18 to 16 is a long diagonal. 18 to 19 is very far.
Is it possible to go 16 -> 1 -> 18?
...19 -> 16 -> 1 -> 9 -> 13 -> 11 -> 4 -> 14...
If we do that, we leave 18 as a dead end. We must visit 18 and come back.
Since 18 is a "corner", it will likely be visited as X -> 18 -> Y.
The closest neighbors to 18 are 1 and... maybe 16? Or maybe it loops all the way over? No.
It has to be 1 -> 18 -> 16? Or 16 -> 18 -> 1?
16 -> 18 is roughly same distance as 16 -> 1.
But 1 -> 18 is very short.
So the sequence 16-18-1 is a triangle. The edge 1-18 is the shortest. So we should use that edge. This means we enter/exit the [1, 18] pair from 16 and 9.
So either:
...16 -> 18 -> 1 -> 9... (16 to 18 is far)
or
...16 -> 1 -> 18... (18 is a dead end) - No.
or
...9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16... (18 to 16 is far)

Let's reconsider the bridge.
Is it possible the loop is ...14 -> 16 -> 1 -> 18 -> (back to somewhere else)? No.
Let's look at **16**. Its neighbors are 19, 14, 1, 18 (distant).
Maybe the path is ...14 -> 16 -> 19...?
If so, how do we get the right side?
Maybe ...4 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> ... then a long jump to 17 or 20? No.
The gap between the right cluster {1,9,13,18} and the rest is the critical part.
The closest points between the right cluster and the rest seem to be:
- 16 and 1
- 11 and 4
- 11 and 16? No.
- 18 and 17? No, huge gap.

So the connections must be at the bottom (11-4 or 11-14) and the middle (16-1).
Let's try connecting via **11-4** and **16-1**.
Path: ...14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 18 -> 1 -> 16 -> 19...
Let's check segments:
14->4: Close.
4->11: Close.
11->13: Medium.
13->9: Close.
9->18: No, 9->1 is closer. 1->18 is closer. So 13->9->1->18.
18->??: 18 is a dead end at the top right. We must turn around. The only reasonable neighbors are 1 and... maybe 17? No.
It essentially has to be connected to 1.
So the chain must include ...9-1-18... or ...18-1-9...
If we are at 18, we have to jump to the next nearest cluster. The best jump from the {18, 1, 9, 13} group back to the left is likely from 1 to 16 or 18 to 16.
Visually, 1 to 16 looks shorter than 18 to 16.
So let's try to sequence it so 1 connects to 16.
Sequence: ...13 -> 9 -> 18 -> 1 -> 16... (But 9->18 cuts across 1. 9->1 is better).
Sequence: ...13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16... (This implies jump 18->16).
Sequence: ...16 -> 1 -> 18 -> 9 -> 13... (This implies jump 16->1, then 18->9 which is longer than 18->1).
Actually, 18->9 is skipping 1.
The tightest chain on the right is 18-1-9-13.
So we need to enter/exit this chain at the ends (18 or 13).
Exit at 13 connects to 11.
Exit at 18 connects to... 16?
Let's check 18 -> 16 distance vs 1 -> 16 distance.
1 is at roughly (x=right, y=mid). 16 is (x=mid-right, y=mid). They are level.
18 is (x=far-right, y=top).
16 to 1 is definitely shorter than 16 to 18.
But if we connect 16-1, we break the 18-1-9-13 chain unless 1 is an end.
Can we do 18-1-16...?
Then we have 9 and 13 stranded.
Can we do 18-9-13-11... (skipping 1)? No, 1 is right there.
What if the chain is **18-1-9-13**?
Then we connect 13 to 11.
And we connect 18 to 16.
This requires the long jump 18->16.
Is there an alternative?
Maybe **16-1-9-13-11**... and 18 is attached to 1?
Like ...16-1-18-1... No, strictly once.
Maybe ...16-18-1-9-13-11...
This uses the long jump 16->18.
Comparing 16->18 vs 16->1.
16->1 is clearly shorter.
If we use 16->1, then we are at 1. We must go to 18 or 9.
If 1->18, then from 18 we must jump somewhere else. But 18 is the corner. There is nowhere else close.
This implies 18 must be an endpoint of the segment entering/leaving the cluster, OR it's a dead end spur which isn't allowed.
Wait, if 18 is a "corner", it has degree 2 in the tour. One neighbor is 1. The other neighbor MUST be a long jump.
The candidates for the second neighbor of 18 are 16, 9 (skipping 1), or maybe 17 (super long).
18->16 is the most plausible "long jump" to close the loop.

So the sequence **16 -> 18 -> 1 -> 9 -> 13 -> 11** seems correct despite the length of 16-18.
Wait, look at **6** and **17**.
Maybe **17 -> 18**? That's a huge horizontal jump across the top.
Is it shorter than 16->18?
17 is top left. 18 is top right. That's the whole width of the image. 16 is much closer to 18 than 17 is.

So I am fairly confident in the **16 -> 18** (or reverse) connection.
Let's re-verify the **16 -> 1** possibility.
If we go **16 -> 1**, then from 1 we go to **18**. From 18 we go to **9**?
18 to 9 is definitely longer than 1 to 9. But is (16->1 + 1->18 + 18->9) shorter than (16->18 + 18->1 + 1->9)?
Let's estimate distances. Let d(a,b) be distance.
Option A: 16->18->1->9. Cost = d(16,18) + d(18,1) + d(1,9).
Option B: 16->1->18->9. Cost = d(16,1) + d(1,18) + d(18,9).
Common term: d(1,18).
Compare d(16,18) + d(1,9) vs d(16,1) + d(18,9).
d(1,9) is small. d(18,9) is large (skips 1).
d(16,18) is large. d(16,1) is medium.
Visually:
18->9 is the hypotenuse of the triangle 18-1-9 roughly. So 18->9 > 1->9.
16 is to the left.
16->18 is hypotenuse of triangle with height difference.
16->1 is horizontal-ish.
This suggests Option A might be worse.
However, Option B leaves us at 9. Then 9->13. This works smoothly.
The penalty is the jump 18->9.
Is there an Option C?
...16 -> 19 -> 5 ... (left side)
Right side handled as a spur? No.
What about 1 -> 16?
Path: ...13 -> 9 -> 18 -> 1 -> 16...
This requires 9->18 (long) and 1->16 (medium).
Compare to 13 -> 11 (bottom connection).
Let's stick to the visual standard "outer hull" approach.
The points 1, 9, 13, 11 form a convex chain.
18 is an outlier.
The standard way to visit an outlier is to visit it from its nearest neighbor and return, but we can't return. We must go through.
So we go In -> 18 -> Out.
In = 1. Out = ?
The next closest point to 18 (besides 1) is 16.
So the connection **1-18-16** (or reverse) seems enforced by the geometry, unless we skip 1 and go 9-18-16 (worse) or 9-18-1 (backtracking).

Let's assume the path is **... -> 1 -> 18 -> 16 -> ...**
Then 1 must connect to 9.
So **...13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16 -> 19...**
This looks like the winning path segment.
Let's trace the rest based on this.
16 -> 19 -> 5 -> 20 -> 17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 7 -> 15 -> 3 -> 12 -> 14 -> 4 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> (back to 16).
Wait, loop must close.
If I end at 18, I must connect back to start.
If start is 16: **16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18**.
Does 18 connect back to 16? Yes, that's the long jump we identified.
Does this sequence optimize the local connections?
16-19: Good.
19-5: Good.
5-20: Good.
20-17: Good.
17-6: Good.
6-10: Good.
10-2: Good.
2-8: Good (best available).
8-7: Good.
7-15: Good.
15-3: Good.
3-12: Good.
12-14: Good.
14-4: Good.
4-11: Good.
11-13: Good.
13-9: Good.
9-1: Good.
1-18: Good.
18-16: Long, but closes the loop.

Is there any improvement?
Maybe at the 3-12-14-4 junction.
Could go 3 -> 15 -> 7...
Could go 12 -> 4 -> 14?
12 is left of 14. 4 is below 14.
12 to 4 is diagonal. 12 to 14 is horizontal-ish. 14 to 4 is vertical-ish.
Triangle 12-14-4. 12-4 is the longest side.
So 12-14-4 is better than 14-12-4.
What about 3-12-4? No, 3-12-14-4 is better.
So **3, 12, 14, 4** is the correct sequence.

What about **10-2-8-7**?
10->6->17.
10->2 is vertical.
2->8 is diagonal.
2->7 is diagonal.
8 is the corner. Must be 2->8->7 or 7->8->2.
7 is closer to 15.
So ...15 -> 7 -> 8 -> 2 -> 10... is optimal.

What about **5-19-16**?
20 -> 5 -> 19 -> 16.
5 is between 20 and 19.
19 is between 5 and 16.
This is a straight line. Optimal.

The only questionable part is the **18-16** jump.
Is there any way to bridge the gap better?
Maybe **18-17**? No.
Maybe **1-16** and **18-9**?
Path: ...16 -> 1 -> 18 -> 9 -> 13...
Cost change:
Remove 16-18, 1-9.
Add 16-1, 18-9.
Visually:
16-18 is very long.
18-9 is very long.
16-1 is medium.
1-9 is very short.
So (Very Long + Very Short) vs (Medium + Very Long).
The 18-9 jump is practically as bad as 16-18, maybe worse because 18 is higher up.
Plus 1-9 is super short, giving that up is painful.
So keeping 1-9 and 1-18 is best. This forces 18 to connect to 16.

Final check of the list order.
Starting at 17 arbitrarily.
17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20
Return to 17.

Let's convert this to the requested format.
17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

Alternative start point for checking: Start at 1.
1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9
This matches my logic perfectly.

Let's double check **2 -> 8**.
2 is at x=~15%, y=~65%.
8 is at x=~5%, y=~80%.
7 is at x=~15%, y=~90%.
15 is at x=~25%, y=~85%.
From 2, going to 8. Then 8->7. Then 7->15.
Is 2->7->8->... better?
2->7 crosses 8's connection? No.
2 is above 7. 8 is left of 7.
Distance 2-8 vs 2-7.
2-8 looks longer than 2-7.
If we go 2->7, then where does 8 go?
2->7->8->15?
7->8 is short. 8->15 is long (passes through 7). Bad.
So 8 must be an end of the chain 8-7-15.
So we must enter 8 from 2 or exit 8 to 2.
Since 2 is the only thing above, and 7 is the only thing right, and 8 is a corner, the sequence 2-8-7-15 is forced.

Double check **3 -> 12 -> 14**.
3 is (30%, 75%).
12 is (40%, 75%).
15 is (25%, 85%).
Path 15 -> 3 -> 12. Correct.
12 is next to 14. 14 is (48%, 70%).
12->14 is correct.

Double check **14 -> 4**.
4 is (55%, 90%).
14 is (48%, 70%).
11 is (75%, 75%).
From 14, is 4 closer or 11?
14 to 4 looks vertical drop.
14 to 11 is longer diagonal.
So 14->4 is better.
Then 4->11 is best exit from 4.

Double check **11 -> 13**.
11 is (75%, 75%).
13 is (95%, 80%).
Distance is medium.
Is there an alternative?
4 -> 13? No, longer.
14 -> 13? No.
So 11->13 is forced.

The solution seems robust.

One more sanity check on **2 -> 10**.
2 is isolated. 10 is above. 8 is below-left. 3 is right.
2-3 is far.
2-8 is medium.
2-10 is medium.
Sequence 10-2-8 is the straightest line through 2.
If we did 8-2-3... that's a sharp turn at 2.
10-2-8 is vertical-ish line. Good.

Final list:
17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

I will present the answer starting from 1 for canonical simplicity, though the prompt says any start is fine. I'll stick to the order derived: starting at 17.

17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

Wait, just looking at **20 -> 17**.
20 is (20%, 20%).
17 is (15%, 5%).
6 is (10%, 15%).
10 is (12%, 25%).
Triangle 17-6-10-20.
Path ...5 -> 20 -> 17 -> 6 -> 10...
20->17 distance is small.
17->6 distance is small.
6->10 distance is small.
10->2 distance is medium.
Is ...5 -> 20 -> 10 -> 6 -> 17 -> 2...?
20->10 is close.
10->6 is close.
6->17 is close.
17->2 is far. 17 to 2 jumps over 10 and 6. Bad.
So we must exit the cluster downwards from 10 or 20.
10 is physically lower than 17 and 6.
So exiting from 10 towards 2 is correct.
So the sequence within the cluster must end at 10.
... -> 20 -> 17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2...
Check 20 connections. 20 is close to 5 and 17 and 10.
If we come from 5, we hit 20.
Then 20->17->6->10->2.
This looks optimal.

One variant: ...5->19->16... wait, 5 is connected to 19.
Are 5 and 20 swapped?
20 is top left center. 5 is below it.
Sequence 19 -> 5 -> 20.
19 is right of 5. 5 is right of 20? No, 5 is below 20?
Let's look at 5, 19, 20 coordinates roughly.
20: (200px, 200px)
5: (280px, 380px)
19: (420px, 480px) -- Wait, 19 is labelled above the dot.
Dot 19 is at roughly (420, 480).
Dot 5 is at roughly (280, 380).
Dot 20 is at roughly (190, 200).
So 19 -> 5 -> 20 is a line heading top-left.
Then 20 -> 17 (120, 80).
This works.

Final Answer seems solid.

Order: 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

Let's do a reverse check.
20, 5, 19, 16, 18, 1, 9, 13, 11, 4, 14, 12, 3, 15, 7, 8, 2, 10, 6, 17.
Looks good.

One detail: **14 and 16**.
14 is central bottom. 16 is central right.
Path segments: ...12 -> 14 -> 4... and ...18 -> 16 -> 19...
Is it possible to connect 14 and 16?
Distance 14-16 is medium.
If we do ...12 -> 14 -> 16 -> 19 -> 5 -> 20 -> 17 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 7 -> 15 -> 3 -> (back to 12).
Where do the right/bottom right points go?
The loop needs to encompass {1, 9, 13, 11, 4}.
They are a "lobe" sticking out.
Connection points to this lobe are 4 and 1 (or 18).
We enter at 4 (from 14).
We travel 4->11->13->9->1->18.
We must exit from 18 to rejoin the main body.
Nearest main body point to 18 is 16.
So 18->16.
Then 16->19...
This confirms the structure: Main body -> 14 -> [Lobe 4..18] -> 16 -> Main body.
This structure is 100% correct.

The answer is 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20.

I will write the output starting from 1 to be consistent with typical example formats, but the order remains the same.
1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9

Wait, prompt example was "1, 5, 3...".
I'll just provide the list.

Let's double check **18 -> 16**.
Is 18->19 shorter?
18 is (980, 180).
16 is (600, 530).
19 is (420, 480).
18->16 dx=380, dy=350. Dist ~ 516.
18->19 dx=560, dy=300. Dist ~ 635.
16 is closer.
18->1 dx=100ish.
18->17 dx=850.

Yes, 18->16 is the correct return path.

Final list verification:
17
6
10
2
8
7
15
3
12
14
4
11
13

(Loops back to 17).

Looks perfect.

One tiny check: 14 -> 12 vs 14 -> 16.
14 (480, 680).
12 (400, 740).
16 (600, 530).
14->12 is dist ~ 100.
14->16 is dist ~ 190.
14->4 is dist ~ 200 (4 is at 540, 900).
Actually 14->4 looks further than 14->16 visually.
Let's re-evaluate the lobe connection.
If 14 connects to 16: ...12->14->16...
Then we have the lobe {4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18} isolated.
We need to thread the path through them.
If 14->16, how do we pick up 4?
Maybe 12 -> 4 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 1 -> 18 -> 16 -> 14?
Let's check 12 -> 4 distance.
12 (400, 740). 4 (540, 900). Dist ~ 212.
vs
14 -> 4 distance.
14 (480, 680). 4 (540, 900). Dist ~ 228.
12 -> 4 and 14 -> 4 are similar.
But 12 and 14 are very close neighbors. Breaking the 12-14 link is usually bad unless necessary.
If we keep 12-14 link:
Option A: ...12-14-16-18-1-9-13-11-4... (Dead end at 4, or must jump 4->??). 4->3 is far.
Option B: ...12-14-4-11-13-9-1-18-16... (My current solution).
This connects 14 to 4 (dist ~228) and 18 to 16 (dist ~516). Total bridge cost ~744.
Is there a better way?
Maybe enter lobe at 16?
...19->16->18->1->9->13->11->4->14->12...
This is the same path, just reversed direction through the lobe.
19->16 is short.
16->18 is long (~516).
1->18 is short.
...
4->14 is med (~228).
14->12 is short.
This is the exact same set of edges.
So the "Lobe" strategy is robust. The entry/exit points for the {4..18} cluster are indeed 4 and 18, connecting to 14 and 16.

Final check: **12-14** vs **12-4**.
Is it possible 3->12->4->11->13->9->1->18->16->14->12? No, tour.
Sequence: ...3->12->4->11->13->9->1->18->16->14->(somewhere else).
Where does 14 go? 14 is close to 16, 12, 19.
If 16 and 12 are used, 14 must go to 19?
14->19 is close.
Then 19->5->20...
So ...3->12->4->11->13->9->1->18->16->14->19->5...
Let's compare this path against my previous one.
Path 1 (Current): ...3->12->14->4->11...18->16->19...
Edges: (12,14), (14,4), (16,19).
Path 2 (Alternative): ...3->12->4->11...18->16->14->19...
Edges: (12,4), (16,14), (14,19).
Compare sums:
d(12,14) + d(14,4) + d(16,19)
vs
d(12,4) + d(16,14) + d(14,19)

d(12,14) is very small (neighbors).
d(14,19) is small/medium.
d(16,14) is medium.
d(16,19) is small/medium.
d(12,4) is medium.
d(14,4) is medium.

Visual estimation:
12 is very close to 14. Path 1 uses this. Path 2 breaks this.
Path 2 uses 12->4 which cuts across.
Path 2 uses 16->14 and 14->19. 16, 14, 19 form a triangle.
16->19 is the direct edge (Path 1).
16->14->19 is a detour (Path 2).
So Path 1 is definitely better because it takes the direct 16->19 and the direct 12->14.
Path 2 takes two detours.

So the solution stands.

17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

I will output this list.

One final check on image orientation.
Is 17 "above" 20? Yes, y-coord is smaller.
Is 6 "left" of 17? Yes.
Okay, map reading is correct.

Ready to write output.

List:
17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9, 1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20

If I start with 1:
1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9

Both are valid. I'll provide the one starting with 17 as it traces the loop nicely from the top left corner. Actually, "1" is often the preferred start index in these problems unless otherwise specified. I'll provide the list starting from 1. It makes checking easier for humans usually.

1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9

Wait, looking at 11 and 13.
Is 4->11->13->9 better?
Or 4->13->11->9? No, crossing.
11 is left of 13.
9 is above 13.
4 is left of 11.
So 4-11-13-9 is the correct convex hull walk.

Final Output Generation.

Based on visual analysis of the shortest path (nearest neighbor logic combined with avoiding crossing lines):
1. Start at **1**.
2. Go up to **18**.
3. Long jump left to **16**.
4. Go left to **19**.
5. Go left/down to **5**.
6. Go left/up to **20**.
7. Go up/left to **17**.
8. Go down/left to **6**.
9. Go down to **10**.
10. Go down to **2**.
11. Go down/left to **8**.
12. Go right to **7**.
13. Go right to **15**.
14. Go right/up to **3**.
15. Go right to **12**.
16. Go right to **14**.
17. Go down/right to **4**.
18. Go right to **11**.
19. Go right to **13**.
20. Go up to **9**.
(And 9 connects back to 1).

This path is:
1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9

Wait, previously I had 16->18?
Let's re-verify 1-18-16 vs 16-18-1.
In the list above: 1 -> 18 -> 16.
This uses the edges (1,18) and (18,16).
My previous logic was:
Chain 11-13-9-1-18... then jump to 16.
This corresponds to edges (9,1), (1,18), (18,16).
This is correct.
The sequence 9, 1, 18, 16.
So the list is correct.

Final Answer formulation.

1, 18, 16, 19, 5, 20, 17, 6, 10, 2, 8, 7, 15, 3, 12, 14, 4, 11, 13, 9
