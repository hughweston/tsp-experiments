Based on the visual positions of the points, the shortest tour is found by forming a convex hull-like path that connects nearest neighbors without crossing.

Here is the step-by-step path:
1.  Start at the bottom left with point **3**.
2.  Move slightly right and up to point **8**.
3.  Continue in that direction to point **2**.
4.  Then to the nearby point **4**.
5.  Move right to point **9**.
6.  Now, traverse upwards and to the right to the far right point **6**.
7.  Move up and left to point **1**.
8.  Continue left and slightly up to point **7**.
9.  Move left to point **5**.
10. Finally, go down and slightly left to point **10**.
11. From 10, the path returns to the start at 3 to complete the loop (this return leg is implied in the cycle but not listed in the answer format).

**Solution:**
3, 8, 2, 4, 9, 6, 1, 7, 5, 10
