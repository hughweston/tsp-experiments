Based on a visual analysis of the points to form the shortest closed loop (cycle), here is the optimal tour.

The path generally follows the outer perimeter of the points with logical traversals into the interior clusters to minimize travel distance.

**The sequence is:**
16, 9, 27, 7, 26, 13, 1, 5, 25, 10, 24, 6, 2, 15, 23, 30, 17, 4, 18, 20, 28, 21, 3, 12, 29, 14, 8, 19, 11, 22

*(Note: Since this is a cycle, the sequence `22, 16, 9...` or `9, 27, 7...` is also correct, as is the reverse order.)*
