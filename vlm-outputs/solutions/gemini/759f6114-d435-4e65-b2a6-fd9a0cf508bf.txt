Based on a visual analysis of the point positions to minimize the total travel distance, here is the optimal tour:

**19, 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5, 3**

**(Or the reverse path: 3, 5, 1, 20, 2, 12, 10, 8, 13, 11, 16, 4, 18, 15, 9, 14, 17, 6, 7, 19)**

### Explanation of the path:
1.  **Start at the top:** Point **19** is the northernmost point.
2.  **Move down-left:** The closest cluster is **7** and **6**.
3.  **Sweep left:** Continue down to the far-left cluster, moving through **17**, **14**, and out to **9**.
4.  **Bottom-left corner:** Loop back through the bottom points **15** and **18**.
5.  **Move east along the bottom:** Travel through **4** and then across the lower middle section via **16**, **11**, and **13**.
6.  **Bottom-right:** Continue the sweep to **8**, **10**, and **12**.
7.  **Right side ascent:** Move up the right edge to **2** and **20**.
8.  **Upper-middle cluster:** Move inwards to **1** and **5**.
9.  **Closing the loop:** Drop down to the central point **3** before returning to the start (though the prompt asks not to repeat the start node). Note: Connecting 3 back to 19 completes a fairly logical loop, though the gap is large. Alternatively, inserting 3 between 5 and 19 or between 16 and 11 might feel geometrically closer locally, but this "U" shape sweep generally produces the best global TSP solution for this distribution. Another strong candidate path puts 3 earlier in the sequence (e.g., ...11, 3, 13...), but visually, ending or starting a segment with the isolated central-ish node 3 makes sense to bridge the gap between the upper and lower groups.

Let's refine the connection of point 3.
Looking closely, 3 is quite central.
Alternative path: 19 -> 7 -> 6 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13... this leaves a huge jump from 13 back to 19.

The most standard "convex hull peeling" approach suggests the outer loop:
19 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> 11 -> 16 -> 15 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17 -> 6 -> 7 -> (return to 19).
This leaves inner points: 1, 5, 3, 4, 18.
We need to insert them.
- Insert 1, 5 between 19 and 20? No, 5 is closer to 1.
- Insert 4, 18? They are near 17/16.

Let's re-trace the most efficient "snake" path:
Start top left: **7, 6**.
Go down to: **17, 14, 9**.
Bottom left turn: **15, 18, 4**.
Move right: **16, 11**.
Now, handle the middle/right cluster.
From 11, go to **3**? Or continue bottom? Let's go **13, 8, 10**.
Up the right side: **12, 2, 20**.
Inward to top middle: **1, 5**.
Up to top: **19**.
Back to start (7).

Wait, point 3 is tricky. It sits between 11/13 and 1/5.
Let's try inserting 3 between the bottom row and the top right group.
Sequence: ...11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 5 -> 1 -> **3** -> 19? No, 3 to 19 is far.
Sequence: ...20 -> 1 -> 5 -> **3** -> ...?
From 5 to 19 is close. From 3 to 19 is far.
3 is closest to 1, 5, 11, 13.
Best place for 3 is likely between the (1,5) group and the (11,13) group.

Final best path construction:
**19 -> 7 -> 6 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3** (and 3 loops back to 19? That's a long jump).

Let's try putting 3 in the middle of the sweep:
**19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20** (leaves a gap).
Let's stick to the perimeter logic with an indentation for 3.
**7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5, 19**
Check distances:
11 -> 3 is moderate.
3 -> 13 is moderate.
5 -> 19 is moderate.
19 -> 7 is moderate.
This seems the most robust loop.

Let's order it starting from 19:
**19, 5, 1, 20, 2, 12, 10, 8, 13, 3, 11, 16, 4, 18, 15, 9, 14, 17, 6, 7**

Let's double check the 1-5-20 area. 1 is below 5. 20 is far right.
19 -> 5 -> 1 -> ...
1 is somewhat far from 20.
Maybe 19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 13... ? Then loop back up the right side?
13 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> (cross back to 7?). No.

Let's look at the density.
Left cluster: 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16.
Right cluster: 5, 1, 3, 11, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20.
Top point: 19.

Path:
19 -> 7 (closest neighbor)
7 -> 6
6 -> 17
17 -> 14
14 -> 9
9 -> 15
15 -> 18
18 -> 4
4 -> 16
16 -> 11
11 -> 3 (3 is central)
3 -> 13 (or 3 -> 1?) 3 is closer to 1 than 13? Hard to say, but 3 sits nicely above 11/13.
Let's try 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19?
Wait, if we go 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19, we missed 3.
We need to grab 3.
20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> **3** -> 1 -> 5 -> 19?
Distance check: 13 to 3 looks okay. 3 to 1 looks okay. 5 to 19 looks okay.
This looks like a very solid loop.

Let's refine the sequence around 3:
Is 16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 ... better, or 16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 1 ...?
If we go 11 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13... we are stuck at 13 with nowhere close to go back to the start (7/6 side).
So the path must flow from left-bottom to right-bottom, then up the right side, then back left.
Left-Bottom: ...16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12...
Right-Up: ...12 -> 2 -> 20
Top-Middle Return: ...20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19 -> 7... (Where does 3 go?)
3 is between 11/13 and 1/5.
So either:
A) ...11 -> 3 -> 13... (Zigzag in bottom middle)
B) ...1 -> 3 -> 5... (Zigzag in top middle)

Visually, 3 is closer to 1 and 11 than to 5 or 13.
Let's try: ...16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19...
Distance 3->13 is okay.
Distance 20->1 is a bit long.
Distance 1->5 is short.

Let's try putting 3 on the return leg:
...20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> 11 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19 -> 7...
This connects the bottom right sweep (12,10,8,13) back to the center (11, 3) then up (1, 5, 19).
This looks very efficient.
Let's trace:
Start 19 -> 7 -> 6 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 3 (long jump) -> 1 -> 5 (no).

Let's look at the neighbors of 3 again.
3 is surrounded by 1, 5, 20 (far), 12 (far), 13, 11, 16.
Best connections for 3 are {1, 11} or {1, 13} or {5, 11}.
Let's try bridging the top and bottom with 3.
Path: ... -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> **3** -> 1 -> 5 -> 19 -> ...
Wait, where does 11 go?
...16 -> 11 -> 13... (standard bottom run).
How do we get from bottom run to top run?
Option 1: 20 -> 1 (gap).
Option 2: 20 -> 5 (gap).
Option 3: 13 -> 3 -> 1... then how to include 20, 2, 12?
If we go 11 -> 3 -> 1, we isolate the bottom right (13, 8, 10...).

Let's try a spiral/S-shape.
19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 11 -> 16 -> 4 -> 18 -> 15 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17 -> 6 -> 7 -> (back to 19? No long jump).
...7 -> 19 is good.
So 19 -> 7 -> 6 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> **?** -> 19.
We need to fit 1, 5, 3 in the gap between 20 and 19.
20 -> 2 is tight.
20 -> 1 is okayish.
1 -> 3 is good.
3 -> 5 is good.
5 -> 19 is good.
Let's try that sequence:
**... 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 19**
Distance 20 -> 1 is the main cost.
Distance 3 -> 5 is okay.
Distance 5 -> 19 is okay.
Is 20 -> 5 shorter? 20 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3? Then 3 to 19 is far.
Is 20 -> 3 shorter? No.

What about 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 11...
Then 11 -> 16... -> 7 -> 19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 20?
5 -> 1 -> 20 is the same bridge.

Let's look at 1-3-5 cluster.
1 is below 5. 3 is below 1.
So vertical alignment is 5 (top), 1 (mid), 3 (bot).
So sequence 5-1-3 makes sense.
19 is above 5.
So **19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3** is a very strong downward line.
From 3, where do we go?
Closest is 11.
So **3 -> 11**.
From 11, we can go left (**16**) or right (**13**).
If we go left: 11 -> 16 -> 4 -> 18 -> 15 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17 -> 6 -> 7 (end of left side).
From 7, we must close the loop to the remaining points (right side: 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20).
Gap from 7 to 20 or 13 is huge. This splits the graph. Not good.

This implies the tour must circle the whole shape.
19 -> 7 -> 6 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16 -> 11 (center bottom)
...now we must go to the right side...
-> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 (right edge)
Now we are at 20. We have 1, 5, 3 left. We need to get back to 19.
20 is high up on the right. 19 is high up middle.
1, 5, 3 are in between.
20 -> 2 (visited)
20 -> 1 (closest unvisited).
1 -> 3 (down).
3 -> 5 (up).
5 -> 19 (home).
Let's check 3 -> 5 vs 3 -> 11 (neighbor).
Wait, if we do 20->1->3->5->19, the link 3->5 is crossing over 1? No.
5 is above 1. 3 is below 1.
Order 20 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 crosses back and forth.
Better: 20 -> 1 (leftward). 1 -> 5 (up). 5 -> ?
We need 3.
Maybe 20 -> 3 (long).
Maybe 20 -> 5? 20 is right, 5 is left-up.
20 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.
From 3, we need to close to 19? No, 3 to 19 is far.
From 3, we need to close to 7? No, huge jump.
The start was 19. So we must close to 19.
So the end of the chain must be near 19.
Neighbors of 19: 7, 5.
We started with 19->7. So we must end at 5 (to step to 19).
So the end sequence is ... -> 5 -> 19.
Before 5, we likely have 1. (Since 1 is close to 5).
Before 1, we likely have 3. (Since 3 is close to 1).
So end sequence: ... -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
Now, how do we get to 3?
Previous point was likely 11? Or 20?
If we come from the right loop (20):
...20 -> 3 (is that the closest?)
20 -> 2 -> 12... all right side.
Is there a better way to weave 3 in?
Maybe 11 -> 3 -> 13?
Sequence: ...16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
Let's check jump 20 -> 1. It's a bit long but there's a gap there anyway.
Let's check jump 3 -> 13. Very short.
Let's check jump 11 -> 3. Very short.
This looks promising.
It avoids the "dead end" at 3 if we approach from top.
It treats 3 as part of the bottom-middle bridge.
Path:
19 (start) -> 7 -> 6 -> 17 -> 14 -> 9 -> 15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
Let's verify the 20 -> 1 jump vs the 20 -> 5 jump.
20 is at (x=big, y=mid). 1 is (mid, mid). 5 is (mid, high).
20 is closer to 1 than to 5? Hard to tell without ruler, but 1 looks horizontally aligned closer.
Also, ending with 1->5->19 is geometrically smooth (moving up).
If we did 20->5->1->3... then from 3 we must jump to 19? No.
The loop must close.
If we integrate 3 into the bottom track (11-3-13), we isolate 1 and 5.
Then we have ...20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
The jump 20 -> 1 is the cost.
Is there a way to avoid 20->1?
Maybe 20 -> 5 -> 1 ... but then 1 is a dead end? 1 -> 19 is far. 1 -> 7 is far.
So 1 must connect to 3 or 5 or 20.
If 3 is used below, 1 connects to 5 and 20.
So ...20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19 is the logical path for that cluster.

Alternative: Integrate 3 into the top cluster.
...16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
Jump 20 -> 3 is longer than 11->3 or 13->3.
So putting 3 on the bottom track is better.

Final check of the bottom track with 3:
16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 13.
16 to 11 is straight.
11 to 3 is slightly up-right.
3 to 13 is down-right.
13 to 8 is down-right.
This is a bit of a zigzag (11-up-3-down-13).
Is 16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 3 -> 1...?
13 to 3 is up-left.
3 to 1 is up.
1 to 5 is up.
5 to 20 is down-right (long).
20 to 2 is down.
2 to 12 is down-left.
12 to 10...
This breaks the flow. The right side (20,2,12...) is a strong column. You don't want to enter it at 20 from 5 and leave it at 12 to go to 10.
The right side flow is 12-2-20 or 20-2-12.
So we must connect the top (19) to 20 or the bottom (10/8) to 12.
We established 19-7-...-10-12-2-20. This is the big U shape.
Now we just place 1, 3, 5 inside.
1, 5, 3 are the "internal" points.
1 and 5 are near 19/20 gap.
3 is near 11/13 gap.
Best path:
19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 11 -> 16 -> 4 -> 18 -> 15 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17 -> 6 -> 7 -> 19.
Let's trace this "Reverse U" with the internal insertions.
19 -> 5 (Short)
5 -> 1 (Short)
1 -> 20 (Medium/Long - unavoidable gap crossing)
20 -> 2 (Short)
2 -> 12 (Short)
12 -> 10 (Short)
10 -> 8 (Short)
8 -> 13 (Short)
13 -> 3 (Short - 3 is nicely nestled here)
3 -> 11 (Short)
11 -> 16 (Short)
16 -> 4 (Medium - 4 is a bit up)
4 -> 18 (Short)
18 -> 15 (Short)
15 -> 9 (Medium)
9 -> 14 (Medium)
14 -> 17 (Short)
17 -> 6 (Short)
6 -> 7 (Short)
7 -> 19 (Medium)
This seems to minimize the long jumps best. The 1->20 jump is the only questionable one, but 1 is the easternmost of the inner points, so it's the natural bridge to the eastern outer wall (20).

Let's check if 1->3->13 is better than 1->20.
If 1->3, then we have 3 -> 13 -> 8... (bottom right loop) ... -> 20.
Then from 20 we have to get back to the start (19/7).
20 -> 5 -> 19.
So: ...1 -> 3 -> 13 ... -> 20 -> 5 -> 19 -> 7 ... -> 16 -> 11 -> 1 ??
Gap 11 -> 1 is huge.
Gap 11 -> 3 is small.
So we need 11 connected to 3.
So the sequence ...11, 3, 13... or ...11, 3, 1... is strong.
If ...11, 3, 13...: we travel the bottom right, up the right wall to 20. Then 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19. (This is the path I derived earlier).
If ...11, 3, 1...: Then 1 -> 5 -> 20? 5 to 20 is far.
1 -> 5 -> 19? Then 19 -> 7... loop continues left.
What happened to the right wall (20, 2, 12...)?
We'd have to go 5 -> 20 (long) -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> 11...
This creates the loop: 19->7...->11->3->1->5->20->2...->13->11? No, 13 closes to 11.
So 19-7-6-17-14-9-15-18-4-16-11-3-1-5-20-2-12-10-8-13- (and 13 connects back to 19? No. 13 to 19 is massive).
So the endpoints must be 19 and something near 19 (7 or 5).
If we end at 13, we are stuck.
So the "Right Wall" must be traversed to bring us back to the top.
Bottom -> Top via Right Wall:
...13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
This works.
Does 11 -> 3 -> 13 work?
11 is (mid, bot). 3 is (mid, mid). 13 is (mid-right, bot).
11 -> 3 is UP. 3 -> 13 is DOWN-RIGHT.
This is a detour. Is 11->13 straight? Yes.
So 11 -> 13 -> 8... is smoother for the bottom edge.
But then where does 3 go?
If we skip 3 at the bottom, we must pick it up at the top.
...20 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 19?
20 -> 1 crossing.
1 -> 3 down.
3 -> 5 up.
5 -> 19 up.
This works well too.
Compare "Bottom Insertion of 3" vs "Top Insertion of 3".
Bottom Insertion: 11 -> 3 -> 13. Costs: (11-3) + (3-13). Saves: (11-13).
Top Insertion: 1 -> 3 -> 5. Costs: (1-3) + (3-5). Saves: (1-5).
Visually:
11-13 is very close. 11-3 is med. 3-13 is med. (Detour cost is high).
1-5 is close. 1-3 is med. 3-5 is med. (Detour cost is high).
Actually, 3 is almost equidistant to 1, 5, 11, 13.
However, 11 and 13 are horizontally aligned neighbors. 1 and 5 are vertically aligned neighbors.
3 sits in the middle of the box formed by 1, 5, 11, 13.
Usually, in TSP, you don't cross the "void" unless necessary.
11-3-1-5-20?
Let's try a vertical cut.
...16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19 -> 7 ...
And the right side?
Start 19 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> ?
13 -> 11? (Close loop).
Then 11 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> ?
5 -> 19 is close.
So: 19->20->2->12->10->8->13->11->16->4->18->15->9->14->17->6->7->(gap)->5->1->3->(gap to 11/13/16?).
If we end at 3, and start at 19... we need 3->19 or 3->7. Both bad.
So the vertical stripe 1-3-5 must be integrated into the loop flow.

Let's reconsider the path: ...16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 13...
Is 11-3-13 that bad?
11 is at x=10, y=2.
13 is at x=12, y=2.
3 is at x=11, y=4.
Triangle 11-13-3. 11-13 is base. 3 is peak.
Going 11-13 is fast. Going 11-3-13 is a significant detour.
Now look at top:
1 is x=12, y=10.
5 is x=12, y=12.
3 is x=11, y=4.
1 and 5 are far from 3.
Wait, looking at the image again.
Point 3 is labeled "3". It is near 11 and 13.
Point 1 is labeled "1". It is near 5.
Point 5 is labeled "5".
Point 20 is labeled "20".
Distance from 3 to 1 looks fairly large.
Distance from 3 to 11 looks small.
Distance from 3 to 13 looks small.
Conclusion: 3 is definitely part of the bottom cluster (11, 13).
It is NOT part of the top cluster (1, 5).
Therefore, the sequence **11 -> 3 -> 13** (or 13->3->11) is much better than 1->3->5.
My previous assumption that 3 was central might have been an optical illusion or misjudgment of the 1-3 gap. 3 is clearly much lower than 1.
3 is y=4ish. 1 is y=10ish.
11 is y=2.
So 3 is much closer to 11.

Okay, new definitive segment: **11, 3, 13**.
(Or 16 -> 3 -> 11 -> 13? No, 3 is above 11/16/13 line. 16-11-13 is a line. 3 is a bump. 11-3-13 is the detour).
Is there a better way?
16 -> 3 -> 11? 16 to 3 is diagonal.
16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 3? 13 to 3 is up-left. Then 3 to where? 3 to 1? (Long jump up).
If 3 connects to 1, we bridge the gap.
Is there any other bridge?
20 -> 1 is the other candidate.
Let's compare bridge "3 -> 1" vs "20 -> 1".
20 is x=18, y=8. 1 is x=12, y=10. Dist ~ 6-7 units.
3 is x=11, y=4. 1 is x=12, y=10. Dist ~ 6 units.
They are similar.
But if we use 3->1, we go ...13->11->3->1->5->19.
Then we have the right cluster 20, 2, 12, 10, 8 isolated.
We need to visit them.
We could go 19->7...->13->8->10->12->2->20->5->1->3->11->16...
Let's trace this:
19 -> 7 ... -> 16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13.
And 13 needs to go back to 19? Or to 16?
We came from 16.
So we have a path from 19 to 13. We need to close 13 to 19.
13 to 19 is huge.
This implies we must use the right-side ladder to get back up.
... -> 12 -> 2 -> 20.
From 20, we need to get to 19.
20 -> 5 -> 19? Or 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19?
If 20->5, where is 1? 1 must be visited.
20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
This leaves 3.
3 must be visited near 11/13.
So 3 must be visited *before* we ascend the right side?
Or *after* we descend?
The flow 16->11->3->13->8->10->12->2->20->1->5->19 seems valid.
The sequence 11->3->13 handles the bump at 3.
Then 13->8 starts the right loop.
Then 20->1 bridges back to the top center.
This seems the most logical optimal path.

Final check of the "bump" at 3.
Is 16 -> 3 -> 11 -> 13 better?
16 to 3 is further than 16 to 11.
11 to 3 is close.
So 16->11->3->13 is better.

Final check of the bridge at 20.
20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
20 to 1 is a gap.
5 to 19 is a gap but they are neighbors.
Is there a way to go 20 -> 5 -> 1 -> ?
1 is a dead end if not 1->3 or 1->20.
If we come from 20, we can go 20->5->1->3 (long jump down to 3) -> 11...
But we already visited 11.
So the direction must be up.
3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.
This requires 3 to be the bridge from bottom to top.
Sequence: ...11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> (where now?)
If we are at 20 and need to go to 3, that's a huge diagonal jump.
So the "Right Side Ascent" strategy forces us to bridge at the top (20->1 or 20->5).
If we bridge at the top, we must have visited 3 already at the bottom.
So: ...16 -> 11 -> 3 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19.

Does 3 connect better to 1 than to 13?
If 3 connects to 1, we can do:
19 -> 7 ... -> 16 -> 11 -> 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.
And 3 needs to close to 19? No.
3 needs to close to 16? No.
The loop is broken.
We need: Start 19 ... End 19.
Path so far: 19 -> 7... -> 16.
Remaining unvisited: {11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5}.
We are at 16.
Go 16 -> 11.
Go 11 -> 3.
Go 3 -> 13.
Go 13 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 2 -> 20.
Go 20 -> 1.
Go 1 -> 5.
Go 5 -> 19.
Close loop.
This seems the only viable topology without crossing lines or massive jumps.

The List:
19, 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5

Wait, let's look at 1-5-20 one more time.
Is 1 close to 20? 1 is at x=12. 20 is at x=18.
Is 1 close to 5? Yes.
Is 5 close to 20? 5 is at x=12, y=12. 20 is at x=18, y=8.
1 is at x=12, y=10.
20 is closer to 1 than to 5?
(18-12)^2 + (8-10)^2 = 36 + 4 = 40.
(18-12)^2 + (8-12)^2 = 36 + 16 = 52.
Yes, 1 is closer to 20.
So 20 -> 1 is better than 20 -> 5.
Then 1 -> 5.
Then 5 -> 19.
19 is at x=8, y=14.
5 (12,12) to 19 (8,14): (4)^2 + (2)^2 = 20.
1 (12,10) to 19 (8,14): (4)^2 + (4)^2 = 32.
So 5 is closer to 19.
This confirms the sequence: **20 -> 1 -> 5 -> 19**.

One final check on point 3.
Is 3 closer to 13 or 11?
11 is x=10. 13 is x=12. 3 is x=11.
It's in the middle.
So 11 -> 3 -> 13 is symmetric and efficient.

One final check on the start of the chain.
19 -> 7 -> 6...
Is 19 -> 5 ... -> 7 better?
19 -> 5 -> 1 -> 20 -> 2 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 13 -> 3 -> 11 -> 16 -> 4 -> 18 -> 15 -> 9 -> 14 -> 17 -> 6 -> 7 -> 19.
Cost of 7->19: (8-6)^2 + (14-12)^2 approx. 7 is x=6, y=12. 19 is x=8, y=14. Dist is small.
This loop is valid.

So the sequence is valid.
I will write down the sequence starting from 19 as requested (or any point, but I'll stick to the generated flow). The prompt example starts with 1, I can start with 19.

List: 19, 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5
Wait, did I miss any points?
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.
All present.

Let me double check the 11-3-13 ordering.
Could it be 11-13-3-...? No, 3 is a dead end then.
Could it be ...16-3-11-13...?
16 to 3 is longer than 16 to 11.
So 11 is the entry to that cluster.
13 is the exit to the right cluster.
So 3 must be between them.
11-3-13.

One edge case: 16 -> 4 -> 18...
Wait, 16 and 4.
4 is above 16.
18 is left of 4.
16 is right of 4.
So 18 -> 4 -> 16 is a smooth rightward flow.
My list has ...15 -> 18 -> 4 -> 16...
This matches visually.

Final confirmation of list order:
19, 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5

Oops, looking at the image again. 3 seems somewhat high.
Let's re-verify the Y-coordinate of 3.
19 (top). 7, 5 (sub-top).
6, 1, 20 (mid-high).
3 ?
17, 4, 2 (mid).
14, 18, 16, 11, 13, 12 (mid-low).
9, 15, 8, 10 (low).
Actually, 3 looks lower than 1, but higher than 11.
3 is roughly level with 16?
16 is level with 11.
So 11, 3, 13 forms a small triangle.
11 (left), 13 (right), 3 (top-middle of the pair).
This confirms 11-3-13 is the right path segment.

Final Answer seems solid.

Let's do a sanity check on the "start from 1" format to see if it looks nicer.
1, 5, 19, 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20
Sequence:
1 -> 5 (Up)
5 -> 19 (Left Up)
19 -> 7 (Left Down)
7 -> 6 (Down)
6 -> 17 (Left Down)
17 -> 14 (Left Down)
14 -> 9 (Left Down)
9 -> 15 (Right Down)
15 -> 18 (Right Up)
18 -> 4 (Right Up)
4 -> 16 (Right Down)
16 -> 11 (Right Down)
11 -> 3 (Up Right)
3 -> 13 (Down Right)
13 -> 8 (Down Right)
8 -> 10 (Right Up)
10 -> 12 (Right Up)
12 -> 2 (Up Right)
2 -> 20 (Up Left)
20 -> 1 (Left Up)
This closes perfectly.

Answer format: Comma-separated list.
I will provide the list starting from 1 for convention, or 19. The prompt says "You can start from any point". I'll start with 19 to match my derivation logic flow.

19, 7, 6, 17, 14, 9, 15, 18, 4, 16, 11, 3, 13, 8, 10, 12, 2, 20, 1, 5
