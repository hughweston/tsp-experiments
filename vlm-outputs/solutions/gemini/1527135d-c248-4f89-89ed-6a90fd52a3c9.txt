Based on visual inspection to find the shortest path connecting all 25 points, the optimal tour follows the perimeter and inner structures to minimize travel distance.

Here is the sequence of points for the shortest tour:

25, 5, 22, 16, 10, 4, 23, 8, 7, 11, 9, 3, 6, 12, 20, 19, 21, 2, 17, 13, 18, 14, 24, 15, 1
