To determine the shortest tour, I will analyze the spatial distribution of the points and trace a path that connects nearest neighbors while avoiding crossing lines, which is a key heuristic for minimizing path length in TSP.

**1. Visual Analysis of Clusters:**
*   **Left Cluster:** Points 3, 2, 8, 4. These are grouped closely together on the left side.
*   **Middle Cluster:** Points 1, 6, 7. These form a central column.
*   **Right Cluster:** Points 9, 5, 10. These are on the right side.

**2. Tracing the Path:**
Let's start from the far left and sweep across.

*   **Start at Point 3:** It's the leftmost point.
*   **Move to Point 8:** This is the closest neighbor moving "inwards".
*   **Move to Point 4:** Closely above 8.
*   **Move to Point 6:** This is the natural bridge to the next cluster. It's high up, similar to 4. Going to 2 first would likely force a longer crossover later. Wait, let's look closer. 3 -> 8 -> 4. From 4, the nearest point in the middle cluster is 1 or 6.
*   Let's try a loop on the left first: **3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> ...** No, going 4 -> 2 is a bit of a backtrack.
*   Let's try: **3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4**. This covers the bottom-left to top-left.
*   From **4**, the natural jump is to the middle cluster. **1** is closer than 6. So, **4 -> 1**.
*   From **1**, go up to **6**.
*   From **6**, go down to **7**. (Path so far: 3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 6, 7).
*   From **7**, move towards the right cluster. The closest point is **9**.
*   From **9**, go up to **5**.
*   From **5**, go to the end point **10**.
*   Now, we need to close the loop back to 3. From **10**, a straight line back to **3** would cut across everything. That's not right. The TSP is a *cycle*.

Let's rethink the "outer hull" shape. The optimal path usually follows the convex hull with indentations.

*   Start at **3**.
*   Go to **2** (bottom left).
*   Go to **8** is not good, it's "inside".
*   Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep.
    *   **3** -> **2**
    *   From **2**, go to **9**? No, that's too far. We need to clear the local cluster first.
    *   How about: **3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 4**... no, that's messy.

Let's look for nearest neighbor chains again.
*   **3** is closest to **8**.
*   **8** is closest to **4**.
*   **4** is closest to **1**.
*   **1** is closest to **7** or **6**.
*   **6** is somewhat isolated at the top.
*   **2** is somewhat isolated at the bottom left.
*   **9** is somewhat isolated at the bottom middle/right.

**Hypothesis Path 1 (Left to Right, then back):**
Start 3.
Go up/right: **3 -> 8 -> 4**.
Jump to middle: **4 -> 6**.
Go down middle: **6 -> 1 -> 7**.
Jump to right: **7 -> 5 -> 10**.
Loop back: **10 -> 9**.
Return to start: **9 -> 2 -> 3**.

Let's check the segments:
3->8 (short)
8->4 (short)
4->6 (medium-long)
6->1 (short)
1->7 (short)
7->5 (medium) - *Wait, 7 is closer to 1 than 5. 5 is far right.*
5->10 (short)
10->9 (medium-long)
9->2 (long stretch across bottom)
2->3 (medium)

Let's optimize the left side. **2 -> 8 -> 4** is better than **2 -> 3 -> 8**.
Is **3 -> 2 -> 9** a valid bottom leg? Yes.
Is **10 -> 5 -> 6** a valid top leg? No, 5 to 6 is very far.

Let's try a "U" shape or "C" shape sweep.
Top path: 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 6 -> ...
Bottom path: ... -> 10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3

Let's connect clusters locally first:
Cluster L: {2, 3, 8, 4}
Cluster M: {1, 6, 7}
Cluster R: {9, 5, 10}

Connections:
L <-> M: Best links are 4-1, 4-6, 8-7, 2-7, 2-9.
M <-> R: Best links are 7-9, 7-5, 6-5 (far), 1-5.

Let's try this route:
Start far left: **3**
Go to **2** (bottom left corner).
From **2**, traverse the bottom to **9**. (**2 -> 9**).
From **9**, handle the right cluster. Go **9 -> 5 -> 10**.
From **10**, we need to head back left.
Go **10 -> 6**? That's a long jump.
Maybe **10 -> 5 -> ...** wait, 5 is already visited.
From **10**, maybe go to **6**? Or is **5 -> 6** better?
Let's look at the right cluster again. 9, 5, 10. The best internal path is 9-5-10 or 10-5-9.
To connect to the rest:
(from 7) -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> (to 6?)
Or (from 7) -> 9 -> 5 -> 10 -> (to 6?)

Let's try path: **3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7** -> (back to start? No 7 to 3 is huge).

Let's find the "bridge" nodes.
Bridge L-M: **4-1** looks very short. **4-6** is okay.
Bridge M-R: **7-9** looks reasonable. **1-5** is okay.

Let's trace a loop:
Start at **3**.
Go to **8** -> **4** (moving up).
Cross to **6** (top middle).
Go to **1** (down).
Go to **7** (down).
Cross to **9** (bottom right).
Go to **5** (up).
Go to **10** (right).
*Stuck at 10.* Need to get back.

Let's reverse the right side logic. Come into the right side at the top, leave at the bottom.
... -> **6** -> **5** -> **10** -> **9** -> **7** ...
This looks plausible. **6** to **5** is a bit long, but might be necessary.
Let's check the return path from **7**.
**7** -> **1** -> **4** ... wait, we need to visit 2 and 3.
**7** -> **2** -> **3** -> **8** -> **4** -> **1** -> **6** -> **5** -> **10** -> **9**.
And close **9** back to **7**? No, cycle must close 9 to start (7).
Wait, start was 7.
Let's re-order to start at 3.
**3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2**.
And **2** back to **3**.
Let's check lengths:
3-8: Short
8-4: Short
4-1: Very Short
1-6: Short
6-10: **Very Long**. This is the weak link. 6 to 5 is better. Or 1 to 5.
Let's look at 6 again. 6 is high up. 5 is middle-right. 10 is far right.
Maybe **6 -> 5**. Then **5 -> 10**. Then **10 -> 9**.
So: ... -> **1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7** ...
From **7**, where to? We need to get back to the left cluster (2,3,8,4).
**7 -> 2**? It's a bit of a stretch but clear.
**2 -> 3**.
**3 -> 8**.
**8 -> 4**.
**4 -> 1** (completes the loop).

Let's trace this full loop:
**1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> (back to 1)**

Let's evaluate the segments:
1 -> 6: Short.
6 -> 5: Long. Is there a better way?
Maybe **6 -> 10**? No.
Maybe **4 -> 6**. Then **6 -> 5**? Still long.
Maybe the middle cluster isn't traversed vertically.
Maybe **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7**?
Path: **4 -> 6 -> 10** (long)
Path: **4 -> 1 -> 7 -> 9** ... then right side ... -> 5 -> 6?
If we end at 6, we need to get back to 4 or 8. **6 -> 4** is okay.
Let's try to end the right side swing at the top.
... -> **9 -> 10 -> 5**.
From **5**, go to **6**? Or **1**? **5-1** is decent.
If **5 -> 1**, then **1 -> 6**. Then **6 -> 4**.
Then **4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2**.
Then **2 -> 7**.
Then **7 -> 9**.
This connects the loop!
Let's verify: **1 -> 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> (back to 1)**
Segment check:
1-6: Good.
6-4: Medium-long, but no crossing.
4-8: Good.
8-3: Good.
3-2: Good.
2-7: Long diagonal. Crosses 8? No, 2 is low, 7 is middle. 8 is higher. The line 2-7 passes below 8.
7-9: Good.
9-10: Good.
10-5: Good.
5-1: Good (better than 5-6).

Is there a way to avoid the long 2-7 jump?
What if we integrate 2 differently?
**8 -> 2 -> 3**? No, 8-2 is longer than 3-2.
**4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 3**?
Then **3 -> 7**? No, crosses 2.
How about **4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 -> 9**?
Let's check **2 -> 9**. That's a very long bottom edge.
If we do **2 -> 9**, then **9 -> 10 -> 5**.
Then **5 -> 7**?
Then **7 -> 1 -> 6**.
Then **6 -> 4**.
Loop: **4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 6 -> 4**.
Segments:
2-9: Very Long.
5-7: Medium.
7-1: Short.
1-6: Short.
6-4: Medium.
This looks like a valid "outer loop" strategy. However, the internal points (1, 7) feel like they should be visited "on the way".

Let's compare the two candidate long jumps:
A) **2 -> 7** (in the previous loop)
B) **2 -> 9** (in this loop)
Visually, 2 and 9 are very far apart. 2 and 7 are closer.
Also, in strategy A, we had **5 -> 1**.
In strategy B, we have **5 -> 7**.
5 is closer to 7 than to 1? Visually, 5 is at similar height to 7. 1 is higher. 5-7 seems shorter or comparable to 5-1.
But 2-7 is definitely shorter than 2-9.

Let's refine Strategy A:
**1 -> 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 1**
Let's look at the crossover at **6 -> 4**. Can we improve?
**6 -> 1 -> 4**? No, 1 is right of 4. 6 is right of 4.
If we go **4 -> 1 -> 6**, we are moving right.
Then from **6**, we must jump to the right cluster. **6 -> 5**? (Long).
Or **6 -> 10**? (Long).
It seems unavoidable to have one longer jump between the clusters.

Let's check **7**.
Is **2 -> 7** the best way to leave the left cluster?
Alternative: **2 -> 9** (too far).
Alternative: **8 -> 7**?
Path: **3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 7**. (Crosses 8-2 and 3-?). No, 2 is below 8. 3 is left of 8.
Path: **2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 7**.
Then **7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5**.
Then **5 -> 1 -> 6**.
Then **6 -> 4**.
Then **4 -> 2**? No, need to close to 2. **4 -> 2** is a long backtrack.
We need **4 -> (something near 2)** or **(something near 4) -> 2**.
The left cluster is a chain 2-3-8-4. Ends are 2 and 4.
So we must enter/exit at 2 and 4.
Connection at 4: **4 -> 6** or **4 -> 1**.
Connection at 2: **2 -> 7** or **2 -> 9** (or 2 -> 1?? No).

So the two main structure options are:
1.  Enter at 4, Exit at 2:
    Route: ... -> 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...
    (Connects 4-6 and 2-7).
2.  Enter at 2, Exit at 4:
    Route: ... -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> ...
    (Connects 2-7 and 4-1).

Let's compare the connections:
Option 1: **6-4** and **2-7**.
Option 2: **4-1** and **2-7**.
**4-1** is significantly shorter than **6-4**.
So Option 2 seems better on the left side.
Left side sub-path: **7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1**.
Now we are at **1**. We have remaining nodes: **6, 5, 9, 10**.
We need to go from **1** through {6, 5, 9, 10} and return to **7**.
Current position: 1. Target: 7.
Unvisited: 6, 5, 9, 10.
Neighbors of 1: **6** is very close.
So **1 -> 6**.
Now at **6**. Remaining: 5, 9, 10. Return to 7.
From **6**, go to **5**. (Long jump).
From **5**, go to **10**.
From **10**, go to **9**.
From **9**, go to **7**.
Loop: **7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7**.
Let's check the jumps:
2-7: Medium.
4-1: Very Short.
1-6: Short.
6-5: Long. This is the main penalty.
9-7: Short/Medium.

Can we avoid the 6-5 jump?
We are at 1. Unvisited: 6, 5, 9, 10. Target: 7.
What if we go **1 -> 5**? (Medium).
Then **5 -> 10 -> 9**.
Then **9 -> (something)**.
We have **6** left.
**9 -> 6**? Very long diagonal. Bad.
So **6** must be visited near 1.
Sequence must be ...1, 6... or ...6, 1...
Could we do **4 -> 6 -> 1**?
Yes. Left side: **7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1**.
From **1**, go to right cluster.
**1 -> 5** (Medium, better than 6-5).
**5 -> 10**.
**10 -> 9**.
**9 -> 7**.
Loop: **7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7**.
This replaces the "6-5" jump with a "1-5" jump.
Visually, 1 is lower than 6. 5 is lower than 6. 1 is closer to 5 than 6 is to 5.
This looks like a winner.

Let's double check the left side connection again.
**7 -> 2**.
Line segment 7-2.
Does it cross anything?
Points 3, 8, 4 are to the left/top.
Points 9, 10, 5, 1, 6 are to the right.
The line 7-2 is clear.

Let's check the crossing of **4-6** and **1-5**.
4 is at (x4, y4). 6 is at (x6, y6). 1 is at (x1, y1). 5 is at (x5, y5).
x4 < x1 < x6.
x1 < x7 < x5.
Path 4->6 goes up-right.
Path 6->1 goes down-left.
Path 1->5 goes right.
This zig-zag 4->6->1->5 is clean. 1 is "below" 6. 4 is left of 1.
So 4->6 goes over 1. Then 6->1 comes down. Then 1->5 goes right. No intersection.

Let's re-verify the right side return.
**5 -> 10**. Right.
**10 -> 9**. Down-Left.
**9 -> 7**. Left-Up.
Does 9->7 cross 1->5?
1 is at ~height of 7.
5 is right of 1.
9 is below 5 and 7.
Line 1-5 is generally horizontal.
Line 9-7 is generally diagonal up-left.
7 is between 1 and 9 horizontally.
9 is below 1 and 5.
So 9->7 comes from below. 1->5 is above. They shouldn't cross.

Let's check another variation just in case.
What if we go clockwise?
**3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3**
3->8: up-right
8->4: up-right
4->6: right-up
6->1: left-down (Wait, 6 to 1 is a backtrack to the left? 1 is left of 6? Looking at the image, 1 is definitely to the left of 6).
Okay, so 4->6 jumps over 1.
Then 6->1 goes back.
Then 1->5 goes right (passing under 6).
This seems valid spatially.
Let's check distances.
4 -> 6: Medium.
6 -> 1: Short.
1 -> 5: Medium.
This is the same set of edges as the previous "winning" path, just traversed in order.
Previous path: ... 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 ...
Yes, that matches.

Let's check if **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5** is better.
Edges: 4-1 (very short), 1-6 (short), 6-5 (long).
Total: Very Short + Short + Long.
Vs **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5**:
Edges: 4-6 (medium), 6-1 (short), 1-5 (medium).
Total: Medium + Short + Medium.
Usually 2 Mediums is better than 1 Very Short + 1 Long because of the squared Euclidean distance penalty, but here we just want sum of lengths.
Visually:
1 is between 4 and 6 horizontally?
Let's look at the X-coordinates.
3, 8, 2, 4 are clearly the left block.
1 is the next one.
6, 7 are the next column. 6 is slightly right of 1. 7 is slightly right of 1.
Wait, looking closely at 1 and 6.
1 is labeled. The dot is to its right.
6 is labeled. The dot is below it.
The dot for 1 is definitely left of the dot for 6.
So **4 -> 1** is a progression to the right.
**1 -> 6** is a progression to the right and up.
**1 -> 7** is a progression to the right and down.
So 1 is a hub between the left block and the 6/7 column.
This changes things.
If 1 is the "gateway" node:
We should probably enter at 1 or exit at 1.
Path **4 -> 1** is very natural.
From **1**, we split to 6 (up) or 7 (down).
If we go **1 -> 6**:
We are at the top. Next is **5** (right). 6-5 is a long stretch.
If we go **1 -> 7**:
We are in the middle. Next is **9** (right-down) or **5** (right-up)?
7-9 is shorter than 7-5.
So **1 -> 7 -> 9**.
Then **9 -> 10 -> 5**.
Now we are at **5**. We need to close the loop back to the left.
Remaining node is **6**.
**5 -> 6**? (Medium-Long).
Then **6 -> (back to start)**.
Start was left side.
We entered at 4.
So we need to return to **2**.
Path: **... -> 5 -> 6 -> 2**.
6 to 2 is a HUGE diagonal across the entire screen. Bad.

So we must loop back via the bottom or top.
Since 2 is at the bottom, we should probably return via the bottom.
So the sequence on the right should end at a bottom node.
End at **9**.
Path segment: **... -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9**.
Then **9 -> 2**. (Long, but connects bottom to bottom).
Let's trace: **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4**.
Edges:
4-1: Short.
1-6: Short.
6-5: Long.
5-10: Short.
10-9: Medium.
9-2: Very Long (bottom sweep).
2-3: Short.
3-8: Short.
8-4: Short.
Is there a way to bridge the middle better?
**9 -> 7 -> 2**?
We skipped 7 in the sequence above.
Let's insert 7.
**... -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 ...**
This breaks the 9-2 long jump into 9-7 (short) and 7-2 (medium). Much better.
Now, where does 7 fit in the flow from the left?
We have **4 -> 1 -> 6**...
If we do **... 9 -> 7 -> 2**, we must have come from the top (6).
So: **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4**.
Let's analyze the **6 -> 5** jump again.
Is there a way to avoid it?
We need to connect {1, 6} to {5, 10, 9}.
Points: 1, 6. Points: 5, 10, 9.
Possible bridges:
1-5 (Medium)
1-7 (Short) - wait, 7 is in the middle group {1, 6, 7}.
Let's re-group.
Left: 2, 3, 8, 4.
Middle: 1, 6, 7.
Right: 9, 5, 10.

We enter Middle from 4. Best entry: **4 -> 1**.
We leave Middle to Right. Best exits: **6->5** (no), **1->5** (ok), **7->9** (ok), **7->5** (ok).
We leave Right to Left (or Middle). Best returns: **9->7** (ok), **5->6** (no).

It seems the best flow is:
Left -> Top Middle -> Top Right -> Bottom Right -> Bottom Middle -> Bottom Left.
Nodes:
Left: 3, 8, 4.
Top Middle: 1, 6.
Right: 5, 10.
Bottom Right: 9.
Bottom Middle: 7.
Bottom Left: 2.

Path:
**3 -> 8 -> 4** (Up left).
**4 -> 1** (Transition).
**1 -> 6** (Up middle).
**6 -> 5** (Transition top). This is the weak link.
**5 -> 10** (Far right).
**10 -> 9** (Turn corner).
**9 -> 7** (Transition bottom).
**7 -> 2** (Transition left).
**2 -> 3** (Close loop).

Can we improve **6 -> 5**?
What if we integrate 5 differently?
**1 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7**? Then where does 6 go?
**4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5**?
Let's check **4 -> 6**. It's a bit longer than 4-1.
But **6 -> 1** is short.
**1 -> 5** is shorter than 6-5.
So **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5** improves the crossing.
Let's re-verify the full path with this change.
**3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3**.

Let's evaluate this specific path again.
3 -> 8: Good.
8 -> 4: Good.
4 -> 6: Diagonal up-right. Jump is moderate.
6 -> 1: Down-left. Very short.
1 -> 5: Right. Moderate. (Better than 6-5).
5 -> 10: Right. Short.
10 -> 9: Down-left. Moderate.
9 -> 7: Left. Moderate.
7 -> 2: Left. Long-ish, but straight.
2 -> 3: Up-left. Short.

Are there any crossings?
4->6 vs 1->5?
4 is (low, left). 6 is (high, mid-left).
1 is (mid, mid-left). 5 is (mid, right).
4->6 goes ABOVE 1.
1->5 goes BELOW 6.
They don't cross.

What about 7->2 vs anything?
7 is (low-mid, mid). 2 is (low, left).
Line is bottom-horizontal.
Points 3, 8, 4 are above.
Points 9, 10, 5, 6, 1 are to the right or above.
Safe.

What about 9->7 vs 5->10?
No, 5->10 is far right.
9->7 is bottom middle. Safe.

Is there a better way for the **7 -> 2** segment?
Could we do **7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2** ... then from 2 to right side?
No, then we are stuck at 2. 2->9 is bad.

What if we weave the middle column differently?
**4 -> 1 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 6 -> ...**
From 6, where to go? Back to 2? **6 -> 2** is terrible.
So we must exit the right side at the bottom (9 or 7) to get to 2, or at the top (6) to get to 4.
Since the Left cluster is {2,3,8,4}, the connection points are 2 (bottom) and 4 (top).
Therefore, the tour must look like:
... -> 4 -> [Top Path] -> ... -> [Bottom Path] -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 ...
OR
... -> 2 -> [Bottom Path] -> ... -> [Top Path] -> 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 ...

Let's assume the order **2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4**.
We need a path from 4 to 2.
Candidates:
A) **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2**
B) **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2**
C) **4 -> 1 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 6 -> (back to 2?? No)**
D) **4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 1 -> (back to 2?? No)**

Comparison of A and B:
Common suffix: **5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2**.
Prefix A: **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5**.
Prefix B: **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5**.
Let's calculate approximate visual distances.
Let's set coordinates.
4: (2, 6)
1: (5, 6)
6: (5.5, 8)
5: (9, 5)

Path A (4->6->1->5):
dist(4,6) ~ sqrt(3.5^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 4) = 4.0
dist(6,1) ~ 2.0
dist(1,5) ~ 4.0
Sum = 10.0

Path B (4->1->6->5):
dist(4,1) ~ 3.0
dist(1,6) ~ 2.0
dist(6,5) ~ sqrt(3.5^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 9) = 4.6
Sum = 9.6

Wait, let me look at the image again.
4 to 1 is a gap.
4 to 6 is a larger gap (hypotenuse).
So 4-1 is shorter than 4-6.
1 to 6 is short vertical-ish.
1 to 5 is horizontal gap.
6 to 5 is diagonal gap.
Visually, 1 is closer to 5 than 6 is to 5.
Wait, 6 is high up. 5 is middle. 1 is middle.
1 and 5 are roughly on the same horizontal band.
6 is above.
So 1-5 is the base of a triangle 1-6-5. 6-5 is a side.
So 1-5 < 6-5.
However, in Path B we use 6-5. In Path A we use 1-5.
So the "Right side" connection is better in A (using 1-5).
The "Left side" connection:
Path A uses 4-6. Path B uses 4-1.
4-1 is the base of triangle 4-1-6. 4-6 is the hypotenuse.
So 4-1 < 4-6.
So Path B wins on the first leg, loses on the third.
Path A loses on the first leg, wins on the third.

Let's check the triangle inequality trade-off.
Cost A = d(4,6) + d(6,1) + d(1,5)
Cost B = d(4,1) + d(1,6) + d(6,5)
Diff = Cost A - Cost B = [d(4,6) + d(1,5)] - [d(4,1) + d(6,5)]
Visually:
4-6 is clearly longer than 4-1.
6-5 is clearly longer than 1-5.
Wait, both "long" edges are in the comparison.
Let's look at the shape.
Path B crosses 4-1 then goes up 1-6 then down-right 6-5. This is a detour up to 6.
Path A goes up 4-6 then down 6-1 then right 1-5. This is a detour to 6 then back to 1.
Since 1 is geographically "between" 4 and 5, and 6 is an outlier "above", visiting 6 in the middle of the path is the detour.
If we do **4 -> 1 -> 5**, we skip 6. To include 6, we must divert.
Divert from 4: **4 -> 6 -> 1**. Cost is d(4,6)+d(6,1) vs d(4,1).
Divert from 1: **1 -> 6 -> 5**. Cost is d(1,6)+d(6,5) vs d(1,5).

Which diversion is cheaper?
Is 6 closer to the line 4-1 or the line 1-5?
Line 4-1 is somewhat horizontal. 6 is above 1. So 6 is "above" the end of the segment.
Line 1-5 is somewhat horizontal. 6 is above 1.
Angle 4-1-6 is obtuse (1 is to the right of 4, 6 is to the right of 1... wait, looking at image, 1 is below-left of 6? No, 1 is left-down relative to 6. 1 is at approx x=4, y=6. 6 is at approx x=5, y=8. So 1 to 6 is up-right.)
Angle 6-1-5. 6 is up-right from 1. 5 is right from 1. So angle is acute?
Let's re-examine positions.
Points:
4 (left, mid-high)
1 (center-left, mid)
6 (center, high)
5 (right, mid)

Vector 1->6 is Up-Right.
Vector 1->4 is Left-Up? No, 4 is Left-Up from 1? No 4 is Left. Maybe slightly up.
Vector 1->5 is Right.
It looks like 4, 1, 5 are roughly collinear or a gentle curve.
6 is a spike above 1.
So the "cheapest insertion" heuristic suggests inserting 6 where it minimizes the added distance.
Insertion into 4-1: Cost = d(4,6) + d(6,1) - d(4,1).
Insertion into 1-5: Cost = d(1,6) + d(6,5) - d(1,5).

Let's look at 4-1 vs 4-6. 4-6 is maybe 30% longer.
Let's look at 1-5 vs 6-5. 1 and 5 are far apart. 6 and 5 are also far apart. 6 is "above" the gap.
The distance 1-6 is small.
If we go 1->6->5, we travel up then long diagonal down.
If we go 4->6->1, we travel long diagonal up then short down.
Visually, the triangle 1-6-5 looks like a narrower triangle than 4-6-1? No.
Triangle 4-6-1: 4 is far left. 1 is below 6. 4-6 is long. 4-1 is medium. 1-6 is short.
Triangle 1-6-5: 1 is left. 5 is right. 6 is above. 1-5 is medium-long. 6-5 is medium-long. 1-6 is short.
It feels like inserting 6 between 4 and 1 (Path A) is "smoother".
**4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5**.
Let's trace it with my finger.
4 up to 6, down to 1, right to 5. Path shape is a 'hump'.
**4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5**.
4 right to 1, up to 6, diag-down to 5. Path shape is a 'sawtooth'.
The 'hump' usually wins in TSP because it avoids acute angles. The angle at 1 in the second path (4->1->6) is sharp backtrack. 4->1 is right. 1->6 is up-right (actually maybe slightly left? No, 6 is definitely right of 1).
Let's look really closely at 1 and 6.
Point 1 label is left of dot. Point 6 label is above dot.
Draw vertical line from 1. 6 is to the right.
Draw horizontal line from 1. 6 is above.
So 1->6 is Up-Right.
So 4->1 (Right) then 1->6 (Up-Right) is not a backtrack. It's a continuation.
Then 6->5 (Right-Down).
So **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5** is smooth.
**4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5**.
4->6 (Up-Right). 6->1 (Down-Left). Backtrack!
Ah, if 1 is left of 6, then 6->1 is a movement to the left.
We want to move generally left-to-right.
So **4 -> 6 -> 1** involves moving Right then Left. That's bad.
So **4 -> 1 -> 6** (Right, then Right) is much better.

Conclusion: **Path B (4->1->6->5)** is superior because it maintains directionality. 4->6->1 backtracks.

Wait, let me double check X-coordinates.
Is 6 to the right of 1?
Yes, clearly.
Is 6 to the right of 4?
Yes, clearly.
Is 1 to the right of 4?
Yes.
So x4 < x1 < x6.
Therefore:
Sequence 4 -> 1 -> 6 is monotonic in X. Good.
Sequence 4 -> 6 -> 1 is not monotonic. Bad. (Goes right to 6, left to 1).
So **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5** is the correct flow.

So, the optimal path order should include: **... 4, 1, 6, 5 ...**

Now let's verify the rest of the loop with this segment fixed.
Segment: **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5**.
Next: From 5, go to **10**.
Next: From 10, go to **9**.
Next: From 9, go to **7**. (Is 7 left of 9? Yes. Is 7 left of 5? Yes. Is 7 right of 2? Yes.)
So **9 -> 7** is a return sweep (Right to Left).
Next: From 7, go to **2**.
Next: From 2, go to **3**.
Next: From 3, go to **8**.
Next: From 8, go to **4**.

Full Path: **3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2**.
Let's check the return loop **2 -> 3**.
2 is bottom-left. 3 is mid-left.
3 is x-min. 2 is slightly right of 3? Or same x?
2 is definitely lower.
8 is right of 3.
So 2 -> 3 -> 8 is a valid "up then right" local move.
Then 8 -> 4 is "up".
This forms the left "C" shape: 2-3-8-4.
Then 4-1 starts the middle traversal.

Is **2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4** optimal for the left cluster?
Distances:
2-3: Short.
3-8: Short.
8-4: Short.
Is **2 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4** better?
2-8 crosses 3? No, 3 is far left.
But 3 is an outlier to the left. It must be visited.
If we do 2-8, we skip 3. Then 8-3 (backtrack left). Then 3-4 (crosses 8?).
Yes, 3->4 would cross 2->8 likely.
The convex hull of the left cluster is 2-3-4-8? No, 8 is inside 2-3-4.
Wait, 8 is between 3 and 4?
Let's look at 3, 8, 4.
3 is far left.
8 is right of 3.
4 is above 8.
If 8 is inside the hull of 2-3-4...
Then we should visit it "on the way" or as an indentation.
Hull path: 2 -> 3 -> 4.
Insert 8: **2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4**.
Cost: d(3,8) + d(8,4) - d(3,4).
This looks efficient. 3-4 is long. 3-8-4 is a slight bend but short edges.
What about **3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4**?
Cost: d(3,2) + d(2,8) - d(3,8).
2-8 is longer than 3-8. 3-2 is same as 2-3.
So **3 -> 8** is better than **2 -> 8**.
Thus **2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4** is better than **3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4**.
Wait, start point doesn't matter.
Sequence **... 2, 3, 8, 4 ...**
Edges: (2,3), (3,8), (8,4).
Sequence **... 3, 2, 8, 4 ...**
Edges: (3,2), (2,8), (8,4).
Comparing (2,3)+(3,8) vs (3,2)+(2,8).
(2,3) is common.
Compare (3,8) vs (2,8).
3 is closer to 8 than 2 is to 8. (2 is low down).
So **3 -> 8** is better.
Sequence **2, 3, 8, 4** wins.

So the Full Path seems robust:
**2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2**
Rotation to start at 1? Or just list starting at any point.
The prompt example starts at 1. I'll start at 1 for clarity, or follow the "leftmost" convention. The prompt says "You can start from any point".
Let's start at **3** as it is "1" in the x-sort order usually used.
Path: **3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2**.
Let's just review the 5-10-9-7 segment.
5 (mid-right) -> 10 (far-right).
10 -> 9 (bottom-right).
9 -> 7 (bottom-mid).
Does 9->7 cross anything?
Line from 9 (bottom right) to 7 (bottom mid).
Line from 4->1->6->5 is all "above" this return path.
Specifically 1->6->5.
5 is right of 7? Yes.
1 is left of 7? 1 is x=4, 7 is x=5?
Let's check alignment of 1 and 7.
1 is (4,6). 7 is (4.5, 4.5).
So 1 is slightly left of 7? Or directly above?
They look vertically aligned-ish. 7 is slightly right.
So 4->1 is clear.
1->6 is clear.
Return path 9->7 comes from the right.
Connection 7->2 goes left.
Does 7->2 cross 4->1?
7 is y=4.5. 2 is y=2.
4 is y=6. 1 is y=6.
Path 4->1 is at y=6.
Path 7->2 is at y=2 to 4.5.
No crossing. The top path is clearly separated from the bottom path.

Final check on the path:
**3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3**

Edges:
3-8
8-4
4-1
1-6
6-5 (Longest edge, but unavoidable to traverse the gap?)
Is **6->10** better? No.
Is **1->5** and **6** visited differently better?
We decided **4->1->6->5** was the best monotonic sweep.
Let's reconsider **4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 1**.
Then **1 -> ?**
**1 -> 2**? (Crosses 7-2? No, 1 is high. 7 is mid. 1->2 goes steep down-left).
**1 -> 8**? (Crosses 4-1 path segments?).
If we do **... 7 -> 1 -> 2 ...**
1 is high. 2 is low-left.
This cuts through the middle of the left cluster.
Ideally we peel the onion: outermost layer first.
Path **2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2** stays on the "periphery" mostly.
The only "internal" points are 8 (handled by indentation) and 1 (handled by passing through).
1 is between 4 and 6/7.
This seems the most logical, non-crossing, nearest-neighbor following path.

One final sanity check.
Could the order of 1 and 6 be swapped?
Path: ... **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7** ... ?
If we go 6->1, we are going down. Then 1->7 is down.
Then 7->9...
What about 5 and 10?
... **1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9** ... ?
7 to 5?
7 is (4.5, 4.5). 5 is (9, 5).
Distance 7-5 is long horizontal.
Distance 6-5 (from previous best path) was diagonal long.
Is 7-5 shorter than 6-5?
6 is at (5.5, 8). 5 is at (9, 5).
dx = 3.5, dy = 3. dist = sqrt(12.25+9) = 4.6.
7 is at (4.5, 4.5). 5 is at (9, 5).
dx = 4.5, dy = 0.5. dist = sqrt(20.25+0.25) = 4.5.
They are very similar.
If we do **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 2**?
Let's check 9->2. That's the very long bottom edge.
Wait, if we end at 9, we must go to 2.
My previous best path used **9 -> 7 -> 2**.
This breaks the long 9-2 edge.
So including 7 in the return path is crucial.
So 7 must be late in the sequence (or very early).
If 7 is late, we traverse {4, 1, 6} then {5, 10, 9} then {7}.
So 4 -> (1,6) -> (5,10,9) -> 7 -> 2.
We established **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5** is better than **4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5**.
So **4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2** is the robust choice.

Let's just confirm point labels.
Far Left: 3.
Low Left: 2.
Mid Left: 8.
High Left: 4.
High Mid: 6.
Mid Mid: 1.
Low Mid: 7.
Low Right: 9.
Mid Right: 5.
Far Right: 10.

Final list: 3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2.
Or rotated: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 8, 4.

Let's verify the example format. "1, 5, 3..."
Just a list.
I will provide the list starting from 3 as it feels like the start of the sweep.
3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2.

Let's write down the output.

Wait, looking at the image one last time.
Is 10 higher than 5?
10 label is "10". Dot is below.
5 label is "5". Dot is right.
The dot for 10 is slightly higher than the dot for 5?
Hard to say. They look very close in Y.
If 10 is higher, maybe **6 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9**?
6 is high. 10 is high-ish. 5 is mid.
6 -> 10 is a long jump.
1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 ...
5 to 10 is short.
10 to 9 is medium.
If we swap 5 and 10: **6 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9**.
6 to 10 is much longer than 6 to 5?
6 is x=5.5. 5 is x=9. 10 is x=10.
6->5 is dx=3.5.
6->10 is dx=4.5.
So 6->5 is shorter.
So visit 5 first. **6 -> 5 -> 10**.

Result holds.

One more check on 7.
Is **9 -> 5 -> ... -> 7**?
If we come back **10 -> 5 -> 7**?
Then **7 -> 1 -> 6 -> 4**?
This traverses right-to-left.
Right side loop: **... -> 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 7 -> ...**
Then from 7 to left side.
**7 -> 1**.
Then **1 -> 6 -> 4**.
Then **4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2**.
Then **2 -> 9** to close the loop?
The 2->9 edge is the killer. It's the longest possible edge on the graph (bottom-left to bottom-right).
We must avoid 2->9.
We must bridge the bottom gap using intermediate nodes.
The only intermediate node at the bottom is 7.
So the sequence **2 - 7 - 9** (or reverse) MUST exist.
This fixes the position of 7 between 2 and 9.
So we have segment **2 - 7 - 9**.
Now we need to connect 9 to the rest and 2 to the rest.
From 9: closest is 10 or 5.
Natural flow: **2 - 7 - 9 - 10 - 5**.
From 2: closest is 3.
Natural flow: **3 - 2 - 7 - 9 ...**
Now from 5, we need to get back to 3 via the top.
Remaining nodes: 6, 1, 4, 8.
We need path from 5 to 3 through {6, 1, 4, 8}.
From 5, go to **6** or **1**.
**5 -> 6** (Medium-Long).
**6 -> 1**.
**1 -> 4**.
**4 -> 8**.
**8 -> 3**.
Loop: **3 - 2 - 7 - 9 - 10 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 4 - 8 - 3**.
Let's check the crossings and lengths here.
2-7-9-10-5: Bottom sweep then up right. Good.
5-6: Diagonal up-left.
6-1: Down-left.
1-4: Left.
4-8-3: Down-left cluster.
This loop is Counter-Clockwise.
My previous loop was Clockwise: **3-8-4-1-6-5-10-9-7-2-3**.
Are they the same set of edges?
Edge set 1 (CCW): (3,2), (2,7), (7,9), (9,10), (10,5), (5,6), (6,1), (1,4), (4,8), (8,3).
Edge set 2 (CW): (3,8), (8,4), (4,1), (1,6), (6,5), (5,10), (10,9), (9,7), (7,2), (2,3).
The edges are identical.
The logic holds.
The path is **3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2**.
Or reversed.
Since direction doesn't matter, and start point doesn't matter, I will provide this list.

Wait, check **3-2-7** vs **3-8-4...**
Is 3 close to 2? Yes.
Is 3 close to 8? Yes.
So starting 3 -> 2 or 3 -> 8 is fine.
If I start 3, 2... then the list is 3, 2, 7, 9, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4, 8.
If I start 3, 8... then the list is 3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2.

I'll pick the one that "feels" like reading left-to-right top-to-bottomish, which is usually starting 1 or the leftmost point 3 and going "up" or "right".
3 -> 8 is going "in" to the cluster.
3 -> 2 is going to the corner.
Usually corner-to-corner is good.
So 3 -> 2 is a corner move.
But 3 -> 8 -> 4 sets up the top line.
The example output `1, 5, 3...` suggests no specific sorting preference.
I will just output the list `3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2`.

Re-read prompt: "Shortest tour".
I am confident this is the shortest tour based on the convex hull + nearest neighbor insertions logic (avoiding the long bottom edge 2-9 and the long top edges like 4-5).
The critical constraints identified:
1. Must bridge 2 and 9 via 7. (Bottom bridge).
2. Must bridge 4 and 5 via 1 and 6. (Top bridge).
   - specifically 4->1->6->5.
3. Left end cap is 3-2 and 3-8 (connecting 2 and 8 via 3).
   - actually 2-3-8 is better than 2-8-3.
4. Right end cap is 10-5 and 10-9 (connecting 5 and 9 via 10).

All these pieces fit together into the cycle:
Left Cap (2-3-8-4) -> Top Bridge (4-1-6-5) -> Right Cap (5-10-9) -> Bottom Bridge (9-7-2).
This cycle is:
2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> (back to 2).
This corresponds to the list: 2, 3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7.
Or starting at 1: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 8, 4.

I will provide the list starting at 1, as it is the smallest number.
List: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 8, 4.

Let me verify point 4 label. The label "4" is near the dot.
Point 8 label "8" is below the dot.
Point 3 label "3" is below the dot.
Point 2 label "2" is right of the dot.
All correct.

Final check.
Is 1->4 better than 1->6?
4->1->6->5 is my path.
Reverse: 5->6->1->4.
Edges are the same.
Is there an alternative top bridge?
Maybe 4->6->1->7 (down) ... then right side is isolated?
If 1 goes to 7, how do we get to 5? 7->5?
Then 5->10->9? Then 9->2? (Very long).
So 7 must connect to 9 (or 2).
If 7 connects to 9, and 1 connects to 7.
We have 4->(1,6)->...
If 1->7, then 6 is a dead end unless 6->1 or 6->5.
If 6->5, then we have 4->1->7... and 6->5... gap between 1 and 6?
No, graph is connected.
Path: 4->6->5->10->9->7->1.
Edges: 4-6, 6-5, 5-10, 10-9, 9-7, 7-1, 1-? (Back to 2??)
1 to 2 is valid but cuts through. 1 to 8 is valid.
Let's compare:
Path X: 4->1->6->5... (Cost ~ 9.6 + rest)
Path Y: 4->6->5... (Cost: 4-6 is 4.0. 6-5 is 4.6. Sum 8.6. BUT we skip 1. We must visit 1 later. 7->1 is 2.0. 1->2 is ~4.5? Or 1->8 ~3.0?
Path X keeps the path on the "upper track" and "lower track".
Path Y dives down from 7 to 1, then must escape 1 to the left.
1 is centrally located. Exiting 1 to the left goes to 4 or 8.
If we go 7->1->8, we cross the 4->6 line?
4 is (2,6). 6 is (5.5, 8). Line 4-6.
1 is (5,6). 8 is (3,5).
Segment 1-8.
4 is left of 1. 6 is right of 1.
8 is left of 1.
Does 1-8 cross 4-6?
No, 4-6 is above 1-8.
However, is 4-6 + 6-5 + 7-1 + 1-8 shorter than 4-1 + 1-6 + 6-5 ...?
Path Y edges: 4-6, 6-5, 9-7, 7-1, 1-8.
Path X edges: 4-1, 1-6, 6-5, 9-7, 7-2, 2-3...
The "Long" edge 6-5 is in both.
The difference is how we traverse the gap between left and middle.
Path X: 4-1 (short).
Path Y: 4-6 (long).
Also Path Y has 1-8 vs Path X has 4-8 (via 3, 2 etc).
Path X uses the natural neighbor 4-1. Path Y forces a longer jump 4-6.
I stick with Path X.

Final Answer Sequence:
1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4
(And 4 loops back to 1).

Double check point labels.
1: mid-left
2: bottom-left
3: far-left
4: top-left
5: mid-right
6: top-mid
7: bottom-mid
8: mid-left (between 3 and 4)
9: bottom-right
10: far-right

Sequence: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 8, 4.

One tiny detail. Is 8 or 4 closer to 1?
4 is closer to 1.
8 is (3,5). 1 is (5,6). dist ~ sqrt(4+1)=2.2
4 is (2,6). 1 is (5,6). dist ~ 3.
Wait.
8 is at x=3, y=5.
4 is at x=2, y=6.
1 is at x=5, y=6.
Dist(4,1) = 3.
Dist(8,1) = sqrt(2^2 + 1^2) = 2.23.
So 8 is closer to 1 than 4 is.
Does this change the entry?
Left cluster exit: 4 or 8?
Loop left: 2-3-4-8? No, 8 is inside. 2-3-8-4 is best perimeter.
If we end left cluster at 8: **... 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8**.
Then **8 -> 1**.
Then **1 -> 6 -> 5**.
Check crossing.
Path **4 -> 8 -> 1**.
Path **8 -> 4** was used before.
Is 3-4-8-1 better than 3-8-4-1?
Triangle 3-4-8.
3(1,4), 4(2,6), 8(3,5).
3-4: sqrt(1+4)=2.2.
4-8: sqrt(1+1)=1.4.
3-8: sqrt(4+1)=2.2.
Perimeter 3-4-8 is 3->4->8. Length 2.2+1.4 = 3.6.
Perimeter 3-8-4 is 3->8->4. Length 2.2+1.4 = 3.6.
They are equal?
Visually 8 is slightly right of the line 3-4?
Line 3(1,4) to 4(2,6). eq: y = 2x + 2.
Check 8(3,5). 5 vs 2(3)+2=8. 8 is below line.
So 3-8-4 is convex? 3->8 (right-up). 8->4 (left-up).
3->4 (right-up-steep).
So 8 is to the right of 3-4 segment.
So 3-4-8 is the convex hull? No.
If 8 is "below-right" of 3-4 line, and we want to go to 1 (which is further right).
Then 3->4->8->1 is "bulging out" towards 1.
3->8->4->1 would go right(8) then left(4) then right(1). Zigzag.
3->4->8->1 goes right(4) then right(8) then right(1). Smooth.
Let's check coords roughly.
3: (1, 4.5)
4: (2, 6)
8: (2.5, 5)
1: (5, 6)
Path A: 3->8->4->1.
3->8: dx=1.5.
8->4: dx=-0.5. (Backtrack in X).
4->1: dx=3.0.
Path B: 3->4->8->1.
3->4: dx=1.0.
4->8: dx=0.5.
8->1: dx=2.5.
All positive dX. Smooth flow.
Distance check:
8->4 is short. 4->1 is 3.0. Sum ~ 4.4.
4->8 is short. 8->1 is 2.5. Sum ~ 3.9.
So **4 -> 8 -> 1** is shorter than **8 -> 4 -> 1**.
This implies we should exit the left cluster at 8, not 4.
This changes the order.
New Path Candidates:
... -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 6 -> ...
Let's check 2-3-4-8.
2(2,2) -> 3(1,4.5). Up-left.
3 -> 4(2,6). Up-right.
4 -> 8(2.5, 5). Down-right.
8 -> 1(5,6). Up-right.
This looks very efficient.
My previous path: 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1.
2->3.
3->8 (2.5,5). Crosses 2-4? No.
8->4 (Backtrack left/up).
4->1 (Right).
The zig-zag at 8-4-1 is the inefficiency.
So **2, 3, 4, 8, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2** is better.

Wait, check the return to 2.
Previous: **7 -> 2**.
7(4.5, 4.5) -> 2(2, 2).
Line passes near 8?
8 is (2.5, 5). 2 is (2,2).
Line 7-2 goes from (4.5, 4.5) to (2, 2).
Slope = 2.5/2.5 = 1.
Eq: y = x.
Point 8 is at (2.5, 5). y=5. x=2.5.
Is 5 > 2.5? Yes. So 8 is "above" the line 7-2.
Point 3 is (1, 4.5). Above.
Point 4 is (2, 6). Above.
So 7->2 is clear at the bottom.
Does it cross the new segment 8->1?
8(2.5, 5) -> 1(5, 6).
7(4.5, 4.5) -> 2(2, 2).
X-range for 8-1 is [2.5, 5].
X-range for 7-2 is [2, 4.5].
They overlap in X.
Y-range for 8-1 is [5, 6].
Y-range for 7-2 is [2, 4.5].
The Y-ranges do NOT overlap. 8-1 is strictly above 7-2.
So no crossing.

So the improved path is:
**2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2**.
Let's verify the "convex hull" of the left cluster again.
Points: 2, 3, 4, 8.
Hull is 2-3-4-8?
2(2,2). 3(1,4.5). 4(2,6). 8(2.5,5).
Slope 2-3: (2.5)/(-1) = -2.5.
Slope 3-4: (1.5)/(1) = 1.5.
Slope 4-8: (-1)/(0.5) = -2.
Slope 8-? 8 is rightmost.
So 8 is on the hull if we connect to 1.
3 is leftmost.
2 is bottommost.
4 is topmost.
So the path traversing them in order 2-3-4-8 makes perfect sense.
8 is the "connector" to the rest of the graph (node 1).
2 is the "connector" from the rest of the graph (node 7).

So sequence starting at 1:
**1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8**.
And loop 8 -> 1.

Let's do one final visual check.
3, 4, 8.
3 is (left). 4 is (top). 8 is (right-ish of 3, below 4).
Tour 3-4-8-1.
3 to 4. 4 to 8. 8 to 1.
This looks like "over the top".
Tour 3-8-4-1.
3 to 8. 8 to 4. 4 to 1.
This looks like "zigzag". 3 to 8 goes right. 8 to 4 goes left. 4 to 1 goes right.
Zigzags add length.
So 3-4-8-1 is indeed better.

Correct Sequence: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.
Let's verify 2-3 vs 3-2.
Coming from 7.
7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.
7 -> 3 -> 2 -> ...? 2 is dead end if we go 3-2. 2 needs to connect to 8? 2-8 crosses 3-4?
If we go 7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1.
7->3 crosses 2-something? 2 is at (2,2). 3 is (1,4.5). 7 is (4.5, 4.5).
7->3 is horizontal.
2 is below.
So 7->3 doesn't cross 2.
But 2->8. 2(2,2) -> 8(2.5, 5). Steep up.
Crosses 3-4? 3(1,4.5) -> 4(2,6).
Line 3-4 passes x=1.5, y=5.25.
Line 2-8 passes x=2.something.
They look parallel-ish. 2-8 is right of 3-4.
But is 2-8-4-1 efficient?
2 -> 8 is long.
2 -> 3 is short.
So visit 2 then 3.
7 -> 2 -> 3. Correct.

Final list: **1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8**
Wait. 1,6,5,10,9,7,2,3,4,8.
Start at 1. End at 8. 8 -> 1.
This works.

Let's try to start with 3 to be safe with standard ordering? No, prompt example uses 1.
I will output starting with 1.

Final check on the labels in the image.
1 is clearly 1.
6 is 6.
5 is 5.
10 is 10.
9 is 9.
7 is 7.
2 is 2.
3 is 3.
4 is 4.
8 is 8.

The tour:
1 -> 6 (up)
6 -> 5 (right/down)
5 -> 10 (right)
10 -> 9 (left/down)
9 -> 7 (left)
7 -> 2 (left/down)
2 -> 3 (left/up)
3 -> 4 (right/up)
4 -> 8 (right/down)
8 -> 1 (right/up)

Wait. 4->8->1.
4(2,6). 8(2.5,5). 1(5,6).
4->8 goes down. 8->1 goes up.
Vs 4->1 directly. (Straight).
Is 4->1 + 8 included elsewhere better?
If we do ... 2-3-8-4-1 ...
8 is visited between 3 and 4.
Cost = d(3,8) + d(8,4).
Vs cost = d(3,4) + d(4,8).
Visually 3, 8, 4 form a triangle.
3(1, 4.5). 8(2.5, 5). 4(2, 6).
3->8->4. 3 to 8 is long. 8 to 4 is short.
3->4->8. 3 to 4 is long. 4 to 8 is short.
3-8 vs 3-4.
3(1, 4.5). 8(2.5, 5). dx=1.5, dy=0.5. L = sqrt(2.25+0.25)=1.58.
3(1, 4.5). 4(2, 6). dx=1.0, dy=1.5. L = sqrt(1+2.25)=1.8.
So 3-8 is shorter than 3-4.
This favors 3->8->4.
My previous analysis "zigzag" was based on X-movement.
But Euclidean distance rules.
3->8 is shorter.
So 3->8->4->1 is better than 3->4->8->1.
Let's re-evaluate the "zigzag".
3->8 is main direction right.
8->4 is slight left.
4->1 is right.
Total length = 1.58 + 1.4 + 3.0 = 5.98.
Alternative 3->4->8->1.
3->4 is 1.8.
4->8 is 1.4.
8->1 (2.5,5 to 5,6). dx=2.5, dy=1. L=sqrt(6.25+1)=2.7.
Total length = 1.8 + 1.4 + 2.7 = 5.9.
They are remarkably close. 5.98 vs 5.9.
Visually, 3-4-8-1 is "cleaner" shape (convex hull).
3-8-4-1 has a re-entrant corner at 8.
Convex hulls are usually preferred in TSP.
I'll stick with 3->4->8->1.
So: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 1.
List: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.

Wait, earlier I said 4->8 is a backtrack.
Now I calculate 3-8 is shorter than 3-4.
3(1,4.5) to 8(2.5,5) is slope 0.33. Flat-ish.
3(1,4.5) to 4(2,6) is slope 1.5. Steep.
It's easier to move flat then steep?
Or steep then flat?
Let's look at the angles.
Angle at 3. Target is 1.
3->4->8->1.
3->8->4->1.
The "smoothness" of the curve.
Curve 2->3->4->8->1. 2(low)->3(mid)->4(high)->8(mid)->1(mid). This is an arc 2-3-4 then drop to 8 then 1.
Curve 2->3->8->4->1. 2(low)->3(mid)->8(mid)->4(high)->1(mid). This goes up, then right, then up, then right/down. Wobbly.
I bet on 2-3-4-8-1.

Final list: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.

One more check: 7 -> 2.
Is there an alternative? 7 -> 3? (skipping 2). Then 3 -> 2 -> 8?
3->2 (down). 2->8 (up-right). Sharp V turn at 2.
7->2 (down-left). 2->3 (up-left). Obtuse angle at 2. Smoother.
So 7->2->3 is correct.

I am reasonably sure of: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.

Wait, is 4 or 8 closer to 1?
8 is closer (2.7 vs 3.0).
So ending left cluster at 8 is better.
So ... -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 1 is better than ... -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1.
This confirms the sequence.

Final Output Construction.
1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8

Let's re-verify the right side.
1->6->5->10->9->7
1(5,6). 6(5.5,8). 5(9,5). 10(10,5.5). 9(8,3). 7(4.5,4.5).
1->6 (up).
6->5 (down-right).
5->10 (right).
10->9 (down-left).
9->7 (left).
7->2 (left-down).
This looks like the correct perimeter sweep.
The only "questionable" link is 6->5 vs 1->5.
Cost 1-6-5: d(1,6)+d(6,5) ~ 2 + 4.6 = 6.6.
Cost 1-5 (skipping 6): 4.0.
Insertion cost of 6: 2.6.
Alternative: 4-6-1-5. Cost 4-6 (4.0) + 6-1 (2.0) + 1-5 (4.0) = 10.0.
Cost 4-1-6-5: 4-1 (3.0) + 1-6 (2.0) + 6-5 (4.6) = 9.6.
Path B (4-1-6-5) is shorter.
So 1-6-5 is the way.

The answer is solid.

One small check: Is 5-10-9 optimal?
Or 5-9-10?
5(9,5). 9(8,3). 10(10,5.5).
5->9: dx=-1, dy=-2. L=2.23.
9->10: dx=2, dy=2.5. L=3.2.
Sum = 5.4.
5->10: dx=1, dy=0.5. L=1.1.
10->9: dx=-2, dy=-2.5. L=3.2.
Sum = 4.3.
So 5->10->9 is better.

Final sequence: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8

Double check prompt requirements.
"comma-separated list"
"Do NOT repeat the first point"
"start from any point"

I will provide: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8

Is 10 higher than 5?
Looking at 10 vs 5.
10 label is higher. Dot 10 is higher than dot 5.
Dot 6 is highest.
Dot 1 is higher than dot 5.
Dot 4 is same height as dot 1.
My coords: 1(y=6), 5(y=5), 10(y=5.5).
My calc 5->10->9 holds.

One edge case: 8 vs 4 order.
2->3->4->8->1.
2->3->8->4->1.
Cost 3-4-8-1: 1.8 + 1.4 + 2.7 = 5.9.
Cost 3-8-4-1: 1.58 + 1.4 + 3.0 = 5.98.
Difference is tiny.
However, 3-4-8-1 follows the convex hull logic better.
I will proceed with 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.

Wait, if 8 is (3,5), 3 is (1,4.5), 4 is (2,6).
Vector 3->8 is (2, 0.5). Angle ~14 deg.
Vector 3->4 is (1, 1.5). Angle ~56 deg.
Vector 8->4 is (-1, 1). Angle 135 deg.
Vector 4->8 is (1, -1). Angle -45 deg.
Vector 4->1 is (3, 0). Angle 0 deg.
Vector 8->1 is (2, 1). Angle 26 deg.
Turn angles:
Path 3->4->8->1:
3->4 (56) to 4->8 (-45). Turn = -101 deg (Right turn).
4->8 (-45) to 8->1 (26). Turn = +71 deg (Left turn).
Path 3->8->4->1:
3->8 (14) to 8->4 (135). Turn = +121 deg (Left turn).
8->4 (135) to 4->1 (0). Turn = -135 deg (Right turn).
Both are zigzags.
However, 3->4->8->1 feels like peeling off the top then the middle.
I will stick with my distance calc which favored 3->4->8.

Final Answer: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.

Wait, looking at the image, 4 is clearly left of 8.
4 is above 3? No, 3 is lowest of the left trio (excluding 2).
Wait, 3 is labeled "3". The dot is above the "2" dot.
3 is x=1, y=4.5.
4 is x=2, y=6.
8 is x=2.5, y=5.
Wait, 8 is to the right of 4?
Label "4". Dot is to the left.
Label "8". Dot is above.
Dot 4 is at approx X=1.8.
Dot 8 is at approx X=2.2.
So 8 is right of 4.
This supports 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 1 (moving left to right).
Moving 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1 would be Right -> Left -> Right.
So 3->4->8 is definitely correct directionally.

Result: 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8.
