To find the shortest tour (Traveling Salesman Problem solution) for the given set of points, we can visually trace the optimal path by connecting the nearest neighbors to form a loop without crossing lines.

Here is the step-by-step visual analysis:

1.  Let's start at a point on the perimeter, for example, point **9** (bottom-left).
2.  The nearest neighbor to 9 is clearly point **7**.
3.  From 7, we move generally upwards and to the right. The next logical point is **3**.
4.  From 3, point **10** is up and to the left, but point **1** is closer to the center. Let's look at the cluster. Point 10 is quite isolated. If we go 7 -> 10, that's a long jump. Let's try to sweep the left side first.
    *   Actually, let's look at the overall shape. It looks like a distorted loop.
    *   Starting at **9** -> **7**.
    *   From **7**, the next closest point to continue the loop towards the top is **10**.
    *   From **10**, we need to move right. The closest point is **2**.
    *   From **2**, we go up to the outlier **8**.
    *   From **8**, we come down the right side to **6**.
    *   From **6**, we continue down the right side to **4**.
    *   From **4**, the bottom point is **5**.
    *   From **5**, we need to return towards the center/left to close the loop. The closest point is **1**.
    *   From **1**, the neighbor is **3**.
    *   From **3**, we can close the loop back to points near 7 or 9? Wait, let's re-evaluate. The path 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 would cross the line 7-10. Crossing lines usually means the path isn't optimal.

Let's try a "convex hull" approach, peeling off layers:
- The outer points form a rough boundary: 9, 7, 10, 8, 6, 4, 5.
- The inner points are 3, 1, 2.

Let's try tracing a path that minimizes distance locally:
1.  Start at **9**.
2.  Go to **7**.
3.  Go to **3** (3 is between 7 and 1/10).
4.  From **3**, go to **10**. (Going 3 -> 1 -> 2 ... leaves 10 isolated). Alternatively, 7 -> 10 -> ? The jump 7->10 is big. But 3 is nicely in between. Let's try: **9 -> 7 -> 3**.
5.  From **3**, the options are 10 or 1. Let's go to **10**.
6.  From **10**, go to **2**.
7.  From **2**, go to **8**.
8.  From **8**, go to **6**.
9.  From **6**, go to **4**.
10. From **4**, go to **5**.
11. From **5**, go to **1**.
12. From **1**, go back to start? No, we haven't connected 1 to the start yet. The start was 9. The distance 1 -> 9 is huge.

Let's try another order, looking for a clean loop:
Start at bottom left: **9**.
Move to **7**.
From **7**, go inward to **3**.
From **3**, go to **1**.
From **1**, go to **5** (bottom right).
From **5**, go to **4**.
From **4**, go to **6**.
From **6**, go to **8**.
From **8**, go to **2**.
From **2**, go to **10**.
From **10**, return to **9**.
This path is: 9-7-3-1-5-4-6-8-2-10-9.
Does this cross?
- 9->7 ok.
- 7->3 ok.
- 3->1 ok.
- 1->5 ok.
- 5->4 ok.
- 4->6 ok.
- 6->8 ok.
- 8->2 ok.
- 2->10 ok.
- 10->9. This is a very long segment. It crosses the whole graph. This is likely not optimal.

Let's look at the left side again. 9, 7, 3, 10.
The best way to connect these is likely 9-7-3-10-2... or 9-7-10-3... No, 3 is 'below' 10.
Better path on the left: **9 -> 7 -> 10**. Then from 10 go to **2**? Or **10 -> 8**?
If 9-7-10... then 3 is left stranded. So 3 must be visited between 7 and 1, or 7 and 10.
Looking at the coordinates:
- 3 is somewhat central.
- 1 is somewhat central.
- 2 is somewhat central.

Let's try a circular sweep.
Start at 9.
Go clockwise? 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... back to 9?
Let's check segments:
9->7 (short)
7->10 (medium)
10->8 (medium)
8->6 (medium/long)
6->4 (long)
4->5 (short)
5->1 (medium)
1->3 (short)
3->2 (medium? no, 3->2 crosses 1's area). 3 is near 7. 2 is near 8.
Actually, 3 is close to 1.
Let's trace nearest neighbors strictly:
- 9 is closest to 7.
- 7 is closest to 3.
- 3 is closest to 1.
- 1 is closest to... 5 or 2? Looks closer to 2 or 5.
- 2 is closest to 8 or 1.
- 8 is closest to 2.
- 6 is closest to 8 or 4.
- 4 is closest to 5.
- 5 is closest to 4.
- 10 is closest to 2?

Let's try linking these short segments:
Chain 1: 9-7-3-1
Chain 2: 5-4-6
Chain 3: 10-2-8
How to connect these chains?
Chain 1 ends at 1. Chain 2 starts at 5. 1 and 5 are reasonably close. Connection: 1-5.
Now we have 9-7-3-1-5-4-6.
End is 6. Remaining points: 10, 2, 8.
Connection 6 to 8 is decent.
So: 9-7-3-1-5-4-6-8.
From 8, go to 2.
From 2, go to 10.
From 10, return to 9.
The link 10->9 is the problem again. It's very long.

Let's try to bridge the gap between 10 and 9 differently.
Maybe the sequence on the left is 10 -> 7 -> 9?
If we do 10-7-9, then how do we get to 3? 10-2-...?
Let's try starting at 10.
10 -> 7 -> 9. From 9, where? Nowhere close except 7 (already visited).
So 9 must be an end of a chain or connected to 3.
Let's try **10 -> 7 -> 3 -> 9**? No, 3 is closer to 1.
How about **10 -> 7 -> 9** is bad topology. It creates a dead end at 9.
So 9 must be connected to 7 and ... something else. The only other plausible candidate is 3. But 3 is "inside".
Or maybe a long link 9 -> 5? No.
Let's assume the loop goes through 9 via 7 and ...?
Actually, looking at the image, 7 is between 9 and 10 vertically, but 3 is to the right.
Maybe **9 -> 7 -> 10**? Then 3 is skipped.
Maybe **9 -> 7 -> 3**? Then 10 is skipped.
Let's reconsider the positions.
(10) is top left. (8) is top center. (6) is top right.
(2) is below 8.
(1) is below 2.
(3) is left of 1.
(7) is left of 3.
(9) is below 7.
(4) is right, below 1/2.
(5) is bottom right.

Let's trace a zig-zag or spiral.
Start 9 -> 7.
From 7 -> 10.
From 10 -> 2.
From 2 -> 8.
From 8 -> 6.
From 6 -> 4.
From 4 -> 5.
From 5 -> 1.
From 1 -> 3.
From 3 -> 9.
Let's check the return link 3 -> 9.
Distance 3 to 9 looks moderately long, but it might be the only way out for 9 without crossing.
Distance 7 to 10 is medium.
Distance 1 to 3 is short.
Distance 3 to 9 is medium-long.
Let's check for crossings.
Segment 5-1 goes up-left.
Segment 1-3 goes left.
Segment 3-9 goes down-left.
Segment 9-7 goes up-right (slightly).
Segment 7-10 goes up-right.
This looks like a plausible loop: 9-7-10-2-8-6-4-5-1-3-9.
Let's visualize the link 3-9. It passes "under" 7. It doesn't cross 9-7. It doesn't cross 7-10. It seems valid.
Wait, is 3 closer to 10 than 7 is? No.
Is 3 closer to 2 than 10 is? No.
Is 1 closer to 2 than 3 is? Yes.
So maybe **...5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8...**?
If we do 5 -> 1 -> 2, then we have 3, 7, 9, 10, 8, 6, 4 left.
Let's try a different backbone.
Top loop: 10-2-8-6.
Bottom/Left loop: 9-7-3-1-5-4.
Connect them.
Link 4 (bottom right) to 6 (top right)? No, 4-6 is vertical edge.
Link 8 (top) to 2 (mid)? Yes.
Link 2 to 1 (mid)? Yes.
So: 6 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4.
Where do 3, 7, 9, 10 fit?
From 1, go to 3.
From 3, go to 7.
From 7, go to 9.
From 9, we need to close to... 10? Then 10 to 6? 10 to 6 is super long.
10 must connect to 2 or 7 or 8.
If 10 connects to 8: ... -> 2 -> 1 ... leaves 10 stranded? No, 8-10.
Sequence: ...6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 9.
From 9, go to 5? Long cut across bottom.
From 9, go to 4? Even longer.
The loop must wrap around.
Sequence: 10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3? No, 1 is closer to 5. 2 is above 1.
Try: **10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10**.
Let's trace this:
1.  **10 -> 8**: Top edge. Good.
2.  **8 -> 6**: Top-right edge. Good.
3.  **6 -> 4**: Right edge. Good.
4.  **4 -> 5**: Bottom-right edge. Good.
5.  **5 -> 1**: Move inward. Good.
6.  **1 -> 2**: (Alternative). If we go 1->2, we are going up.
    Let's stick to **5 -> 1**.
    From 1, where to go? 2 or 3?
    If we go **1 -> 2**: then from 2 we must go to 3 or 7 or 10?
    But we started at 10. So we can't go 2->10 immediately unless we are closing. But we haven't visited 9,7,3.
    So from 2, we must go to 3? 2->3 is a bit far. 2 is near 8 and 1.
    
    Let's re-examine the cluster in the middle: 1, 2, 3.
    1 is central low. 2 is central high. 3 is central left.
    8 is above 2. 10 is left of 2/8.
    
    Let's try path: **10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10**.
    - 10 -> 2: Good.
    - 2 -> 8: Good.
    - 8 -> 6: Good.
    - 6 -> 4: Good.
    - 4 -> 5: Good.
    - 5 -> 1: Good.
    - 1 -> 3: Shortest link from 1 to the left side. Good.
    - 3 -> 7: Short link. Good.
    - 7 -> 9: Short link. Good.
    - 9 -> 10: Long closing link. This is the suspicious one. The line 9->10 goes right past 7. It forms a triangle 9-7-10.
    Is there a crossing?
    The line 9->10 might cross 3->7? No, 3 is to the right of the 7-10 line.
    But is 9->10 shorter than alternatives?
    Alternative close: **9 -> 3**? We used 3->7.
    Alternative: **7 -> 10**.
    Let's rearrange the left side order.
    Coming from the right side (point 1 or 2)...
    If we arrive at 3 (e.g. from 1):
    Path: ... -> 1 -> 3.
    From 3, we have 7, 9, 10 unvisited (in the left sector).
    We can go **3 -> 9** (medium). Then **9 -> 7** (short). Then **7 -> 10** (medium). Then **10 -> 2** (to close loop).
    Let's check this complete loop:
    **10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10**.
    Let's trace edges:
    - 10-2
    - 2-8
    - 8-6
    - 6-4
    - 4-5
    - 5-1
    - 1-3
    - 3-9 (This cuts across 7? No, 3 is higher/righter than 7? No, 3 is to the right of 7. 9 is below 7. So 3->9 goes down-left. 7 is to the left of this line. Okay.)
    - 9-7 (Up)
    - 7-10 (Up-right)
    - 10-2 (Right)
    This creates a loop.
    Does 7-10 cross anything? No.
    Does 3-9 cross anything? It might be close to 1-5? No.
    Does it cross 7-10? No.
    It looks like a valid "C" shape loop.
    
    Let's compare **...1->3->9->7->10...** with **...1->3->7->9->10...**
    Option A: 1->3, 3->9, 9->7, 7->10.
       Lengths: 1-3 (short), 3-9 (longish), 9-7 (short), 7-10 (medium).
       Total "cost" roughly: S + L + S + M.
    Option B: 1->3, 3->7, 7->9, 9->10.
       Lengths: 1-3 (short), 3-7 (short), 7-9 (short), 9-10 (very long).
       Total "cost": S + S + S + XL.
       Option A looks better because 3-9 is shorter than 9-10. 9-10 is the full height of the left side. 3-9 is a diagonal.
       
    Is there an Option C?
    Maybe enter the left cluster differently.
    From 2 -> 10 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 2.
    Trace:
    - 2-10 (Left)
    - 10-7 (Down-left)
    - 7-9 (Down)
    - 9-3 (Up-right, medium length)
    - 3-1 (Right, short)
    - 1-5 (Down-right, medium)
    - 5-4 (Right-up, short)
    - 4-6 (Up, longish)
    - 6-8 (Left-up, medium)
    - 8-2 (Left-down, short)
    
    Let's compare Option A loop vs Option C loop.
    Option A: 10-2-8-6-4-5-1-3-9-7-10. (Closing link 7-10).
    Option C: 2-10-7-9-3-1-5-4-6-8-2. (Closing link 8-2).
    Actually these are the same set of edges just reversed direction?
    Let's check the edges used:
    A: (10-2), (2-8), (8-6), (6-4), (4-5), (5-1), (1-3), (3-9), (9-7), (7-10).
    C: (2-10), (10-7), (7-9), (9-3), (3-1), (1-5), (5-4), (4-6), (6-8), (8-2).
    Yes, they use the exact same edges.
    So the decision is essentially: Is the path **9-3-1** better than **9-7-3-1**?
    Wait.
    Path A uses edge 3-9. Path C uses edge 9-3. Same edge.
    Path A uses edge 9-7. Path C uses edge 7-9. Same edge.
    Wait, let's look at Option B again.
    Option B edges: 1-3, 3-7, 7-9, 9-10, 10-2...
    Comparing A/C edges vs B edges:
    Common: 10-2, 2-8, 8-6, 6-4, 4-5, 5-1.
    Difference is in the left cluster (points 3,7,9,10).
    Configuration 1 (A/C): 1-3, 3-9, 9-7, 7-10. Sum = d(1,3)+d(3,9)+d(9,7)+d(7,10).
    Configuration 2 (B): 1-3, 3-7, 7-9, 9-10. Sum = d(1,3)+d(3,7)+d(7,9)+d(9,10).
    
    Let's visually estimate lengths.
    d(1,3) is common.
    Compare: d(3,9) + d(9,7) + d(7,10)  VS  d(3,7) + d(7,9) + d(9,10).
    Remove common d(7,9) and d(9,7).
    Compare: d(3,9) + d(7,10)  VS  d(3,7) + d(9,10).
    Visual check:
    d(3,7) is very short.
    d(9,10) is very long (diagonal across left side).
    d(3,9) is medium (diagonal).
    d(7,10) is medium (vertical side).
    
    Is (Medium + Medium) < (Short + Very Long)?
    Usually, yes. By triangle inequality and general TSP heuristics (avoid long edges), splitting the long edge 9-10 into 9-3 + ... is usually better if the detours aren't huge.
    Let's look at the quad formed by 9, 7, 10, 3.
    It's not a convex quad. 3 is "inside" the triangle 9-7-10 roughly.
    Actually, 7 is to the left. 10 is top-left. 9 is bottom-left. 3 is somewhat to the right of the 7-10 line? Let's trace coordinates roughly.
    x_7 < x_10
    x_7 < x_9
    y_9 < y_7 < y_10.
    So 7 is on the left edge. 9 is bottom, 10 is top.
    3 is to the right. x_3 > x_7. y_3 is between y_9 and y_10.
    So we have a "C" shape of 9-7-10 facing right. 3 is inside the opening.
    To connect 9, 7, 10 and 3:
    Cycle 9-7-10-3-9 would be a convex hull + inner point? No.
    If we do 9-7-10, we skip 3.
    If we do 9-7-3-10, we make a zig-zag.
    Lengths:
    d(9,7) + d(7,3) + d(3,10) + d(10,...)
    vs
    d(9,7) + d(7,10) + d(10,...) (skipping 3)
    vs
    d(..., 3) + d(3,9) + d(9,7) + d(7,10) + d(10,...)
    
    Let's re-evaluate the edge 3-9 vs 3-7.
    3 is visibly closer to 7 than to 9.
    3 is visibly closer to 1 than to 9.
    So 3 wants to connect to 7 and 1.
    This implies sequence ...1 - 3 - 7...
    From 7, closest unvisited is 9 or 10.
    If we go 7 -> 10, then 9 is stranded (must connect to 7 and ?).
    If we go 7 -> 9, then 10 is stranded (must connect to 7 and ?).
    Wait, the tour is a loop.
    Sequence: ...1 - 3 - 7 - 9 ...
    From 9, we must go somewhere. Only options are back to 3 (cycle), or to a new point.
    Closest points to 9 are 7 (visited) and 3 (visited). Next closest is 10? Or maybe 5?
    9 to 5 is very long across the bottom.
    9 to 10 is very long up the left side.
    
    Is there a point I missed?
    Maybe 3 connects to 10?
    Sequence: ...1 - 3 - 10 - 7 - 9 ...
    From 9, close the loop to where? 5?
    Let's look at the bottom right closing.
    If the loop ends at 9, and starts at, say, 4.
    4-5-1-3-10-7-9.
    We need to close 9 to 4. That is huge.
    
    This suggests 9 is NOT an endpoint of the chain but a turning point.
    Meaning the tour goes into 9 and comes out immediately to a neighbor.
    Neighbors of 9: 7 is the only close one.
    This implies 9 is a "leaf" in a spanning tree sense, so in a TSP tour, it must be connected to its two closest neighbors to avoid long edges.
    The two closest neighbors to 9 are 7 and ... who?
    Distance 9-7 is small.
    Distance 9-3 is medium.
    Distance 9-5 is large.
    Distance 9-10 is large.
    So the connections to 9 MUST be 7 and 3. Any other connection adds significant length.
    Therefore, the segment **3 - 9 - 7** (or 7-9-3) is highly likely to be part of the optimal tour.
    
    If we fix **3 - 9 - 7**:
    Now we need to connect 7 and 3 to the rest.
    7 is close to 10. So **9 - 7 - 10**.
    3 is close to 1. So **1 - 3 - 9**.
    Combining these: **1 - 3 - 9 - 7 - 10**.
    Now trace from 10:
    Closest to 10 (besides 7) is 2. So **10 - 2**.
    From 2:
    Closest (besides 10) is 8 or 1.
    If we go **2 - 1**, we close a small loop 1-3-9-7-10-2-1. But we missed 4,5,6,8.
    So from 2, we must go to 8. **2 - 8**.
    From 8:
    Closest is 6. **8 - 6**.
    From 6:
    Closest is 4. **6 - 4**.
    From 4:
    Closest is 5. **4 - 5**.
    From 5:
    Closest is 1. **5 - 1**.
    This connects back to the start of our chain.
    
    Proposed Tour: **1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1**.
    Let's verify the edges visually:
    1 -> 3: Short, horizontal-ish. OK.
    3 -> 9: Diagonal down-left. Crosses nothing. Length is acceptable compared to alternatives. OK.
    9 -> 7: Short, up-right. OK.
    7 -> 10: Medium, up-right. OK.
    10 -> 2: Medium, right. OK.
    2 -> 8: Short, up. OK.
    8 -> 6: Medium, right. OK.
    6 -> 4: Longish, down. OK.
    4 -> 5: Short, down-left. OK.
    5 -> 1: Medium, left-up. OK.
    
    Let's double check the "3-9" vs "3-7" decision again.
    If we did 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 2...
    Edges: 1-3, 3-7, 7-9, 9-10.
    As analyzed before, 9-10 is very long.
    The detour 3->9->7 (going down to 9 then back up to 7) uses two medium/short legs.
    The path 3->7->9->10 goes down then WAY up.
    Geometrically, 9 is a sharp corner. 7-9-3 is a much more acute angle than 7-9-10 (which is 180 degrees straight line basically? No, 7 is between 9 and 10).
    Wait, looking at 9, 7, 10. They are almost collinear. 7 is between 9 and 10.
    If 7 is between 9 and 10, then 9-7-10 is the straight line path.
    Going 9-10 directly is just the sum of 9-7 and 7-10 roughly.
    BUT, we have to visit 7.
    We can't do 9-10 and skip 7.
    We have to visit all nodes.
    
    If 9, 7, 10 are roughly collinear:
    A path ...-9-7-10-... is smooth.
    A path ...-9-10-7-... involves backtracking (bad).
    A path ...-7-9-10-... involves backtracking (bad).
    So the sequence MUST be 9-7-10 or 10-7-9.
    This confirms the segment **9-7-10**.
    
    Now, how to connect to 9?
    Must come from somewhere else.
    Candidates: 3, 1, 5.
    3 is closest.
    So **3 - 9**.
    
    How to connect to 10?
    Must go to somewhere else.
    Candidates: 2, 8.
    2 is closest.
    So **10 - 2**.
    
    So the sequence **3 - 9 - 7 - 10 - 2** is extremely strong.
    
    Now the rest of the points: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8.
    We are at 2.
    From 2, closest unvisited is 8. So **2 - 8**.
    From 8, closest unvisited is 6. So **8 - 6**.
    From 6, closest unvisited is 4. So **6 - 4**.
    From 4, closest unvisited is 5. So **4 - 5**.
    From 5, closest unvisited is 1. So **5 - 1**.
    From 1, we must close the loop to 3 (start of our chain).
    Distance 1-3 is very short.
    
    This constructs the full cycle:
    **3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3**.
    
    Let's verify no crossing lines.
    - 3-9 vs 5-1? 3-9 is far left. 5-1 is bottom right. No intersection.
    - 3-9 vs 1-3? Connected.
    - 4-5 vs 6-4? Connected.
    - 6-4 vs 8-6? Connected.
    - Any long cross links?
    - 6-4 is the longest link on the right. Is there a better way?
    Maybe 6-5? No.
    Maybe 8-4? Crosses 6-something?
    The right side points are 8, 6, 4, 5 forming a convex boundary. The order 8-6-4-5 is the natural boundary traversal.
    The connection 5-1 brings us back inside.
    The connection 2-8 takes us to the boundary.
    The connection 10-2 takes us from left boundary to center-top.
    The sequence on the left 9-7-10 traverses the left boundary.
    The link 1-3 connects center-bottom to center-left.
    The link 3-9 connects center-left to bottom-left.
    
    This looks like the optimal solution.
    
    Let's write down the sequence starting from 1 as requested in the example format.
    Start at 1.
    Next is 3.
    Next is 9.
    Next is 7.
    Next is 10.
    Next is 2.
    Next is 8.
    Next is 6.
    Next is 4.
    Next is 5.
    (Back to 1).
    
    Sequence: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5.
    
    Let's double check alternative for 1-2 connection.
    What if the loop was ...10-2-1-5-4-6-8...?
    If 10-2-1..., then from 1 go to 3, then 9, then 7, then back to 10?
    Path: 10-2-1-3-9-7-10.
    Let's check edges:
    10-2
    2-1
    1-3
    3-9
    9-7
    7-10
    This is a sub-loop. Where are 8,6,4,5?
    They are off 2 or 1.
    If off 2: 2-8-6-4-5-1.
    Combine: 10 -> ... -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10.
    Wait, previously I had 10 -> 2 -> 8. Now I'm considering 10 -> 2 -> 1?
    Distance 2-8 vs 2-1.
    2 is between 1 and 8 vertically.
    2 is slightly right of 1.
    8 is above 2.
    Visually 2-8 is shorter than 2-1.
    Also 1 is needed to connect to 5 and 3.
    1 is a hub for 3 and 5.
    If we do 2-1, we use up one of 1's ports.
    Then 1 must connect to 3 or 5.
    If 1 connects to 2 and 3, then 5 is stranded from 1. 5 must connect to 4 and ...?
    5 is in corner. Neighbors are 4 and 1.
    So 5 MUST connect to 1.
    So 1-5 is a mandatory edge (or highly probable).
    1 has neighbors 3, 2, 5.
    Dist(1,3) is short.
    Dist(1,5) is medium.
    Dist(1,2) is medium.
    So 1 should connect to 3 and 5.
    This implies the path segment **3 - 1 - 5**.
    
    If **3 - 1 - 5** is fixed:
    And **9 - 7 - 10** is fixed.
    And **6 - 4 - 5** is fixed (corner logic for 4 and 5? 4 connects to 6 and 5. 5 connects to 4 and 1).
    So chain: **6 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 3**.
    Now we have ends at 6 and 3.
    Remaining nodes: 2, 8, 9, 7, 10.
    From 3, we must go to 9 (closest). So **3 - 9**.
    From 9, we must go to 7. So **9 - 7**.
    From 7, we must go to 10. So **7 - 10**.
    From 10, we must go to 2. So **10 - 2**.
    From 2, we must go to 8. So **2 - 8**.
    From 8, we must close to 6. **8 - 6**.
    
    This confirms the entire loop.
    Loop: 1-3-9-7-10-2-8-6-4-5-1.
    
    Let's check one variation: **10-8-2** instead of **10-2-8**.
    If we do 7-10-8...
    Then 8-2...
    Then 2-6... (crossing?)
    2 is "below" 8. 6 is right of 8.
    Angle 10-8-6 is reasonable.
    Then 6-2? No, 6 is far from 2. 6 is closer to 4 and 8.
    2 is somewhat isolated in the center-top. It sits between 10, 8, 1.
    It needs 2 connections.
    Closest to 2 are 8, 10, 1.
    We established 1 connects to 3,5. So 1 is not available for 2.
    So 2 must connect to 8 and 10.
    So **10 - 2 - 8** is fixed.
    
    So the sequence is robust.
    
    Final check of the list order.
    Start point: 1.
    Direction: Towards 3 or 5?
    Let's list: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5.
    Edges:
    1-3
    3-9
    9-7
    7-10
    10-2
    2-8
    8-6
    6-4
    4-5
    5-1
    All look optimal nearest-neighbor moves that respect the overall loop topology.

    The path follows the points:
    1
    3
    9
    7
    10
    2
    8
    6
    4
    5
    ... and back to 1.

    Let's re-read the point labels to ensure no confusion.
    1 (center low)
    2 (center high)
    3 (center left)
    4 (bottom right - wait, 4 is mid right, 5 is bottom right? No. 4 is above 5. 5 is the lowest point on the right. 4 is between 6 and 5 vertically).
    5 (bottom right)
    6 (top right)
    7 (mid left)
    8 (top center)
    9 (bottom left)
    10 (top left)
    
    Order:
    1 -> 3 (leftwards)
    3 -> 9 (down-left)
    9 -> 7 (up)
    7 -> 10 (up-right)
    10 -> 2 (right-down)
    2 -> 8 (up-right)
    8 -> 6 (right-down)
    6 -> 4 (down)
    4 -> 5 (down-left)
    5 -> 1 (left-up)
    
    Seems perfect.

    List: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5

    Alternative starting point for verification:
    Start at 10.
    10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 9, 7.
    
    Let's check if 8->2->10 is better or 8->10 is better?
    If 8->10, then 10->7...
    Where does 2 go?
    If 8->10, 2 is skipped.
    8 connects to 2?
    8 closest neighbors are 2 and 6. 10 is further.
    So 8 should connect to 2.
    2 closest neighbors are 8 and 10 (and 1).
    So 2-8 is strong.
    10 closest neighbors are 7 and 2.
    So 10-2 is strong.
    Therefore 10-2-8 is the sequence.

    Final Answer Formulation.
    List: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5
    Double check against "Provide your answer as a comma-separated list...".
    
    One more check: Is 3->7 better than 3->9?
    If 1 -> 3 -> 7...
    Then from 7, go to 9? 7->9.
    From 9, go to 10? 9->10 is that very long diagonal.
    From 9, go to ?
    If 3->7->10... then 9 is isolated.
    If 3->7->9... then from 9 we have a problem getting back to the top (10, 2, 8) without a long edge. 9->10 is long. 9->2 is long. 9->8 is very long.
    So 9 must NOT be the end of the left-side sequence.
    It must be in the middle: ... -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> ...
    This allows us to leave the left cluster via 7->10, which is a reasonable edge.
    If we end at 9, we are stuck in the corner.
    So the turn-around must happen at 9.
    This enforces the 3-9-7 order.

    Solution seems solid.

    Final list: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5.

    Wait, I can reverse it too.
    1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 2, 10, 7, 9, 3.
    Both are valid. I will provide one. The order 1->3... seems to follow the counter-clockwise(-ish) flow if starting from bottom-center and going left. Actually 1 is center. 3 is left. 9 is bottom left. This is clockwise?
    1(center) -> 3(left) -> 9(bottom-left) -> 7(mid-left) -> 10(top-left) -> 2(top-center) -> 8(top-right-ish) -> 6(far-right) -> 4(low-right) -> 5(bottom-right) -> 1.
    This is a clockwise traversal of the points.

    Let's verify the point labels one last time from the image.
    10: Top Left
    8: Top center-right
    6: Far right
    2: Center, slightly high
    1: Center, slightly low
    3: Center left
    7: Left
    9: Bottom left
    4: Lower right (above 5)
    5: Bottom right
    
    My list: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5.
    1 -> 3: ok
    3 -> 9: ok
    9 -> 7: ok
    7 -> 10: ok
    10 -> 2: ok
    2 -> 8: ok
    8 -> 6: ok
    6 -> 4: ok
    4 -> 5: ok
    5 -> 1: ok

    Looks good.

    Just to be absolutely sure about 4 and 5.
    4 is labeled above the dot.
    5 is labeled left of the dot.
    The dot for 4 is higher than the dot for 5.
    The dot for 5 is the lowest right-most point.
    So 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 makes sense.
    
    Ready.

    Answer: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5

    One sanity check on 2->8 vs 2->6?
    2 is much closer to 8 than to 6.
    6 is quite far to the right. 8 is just above 2.
    
    Sanity check on 10->2 vs 10->8?
    10 is top left. 8 is top right-ish. 2 is in between and lower.
    10->8 is a long top edge.
    10->2 is shorter.
    Also if we do 10->8, then 2 is likely stranded or forces a crossing.
    If 10->8->6->4->5->1->2... then 2 must go to 3/7/9?
    2->3 crosses 1-something? 1-2 is the edge.
    So ...1->2->3...
    Then from 3 to 9 to 7 to 10?
    Loop: 10-8-6-4-5-1-2-3-9-7-10.
    Compare edges:
    Common: 8-6-4-5-1, 3-9-7.
    Set 1 (Mine): 7-10, 10-2, 2-8, 1-3.
    Set 2 (Alt): 7-10, 10-8, 8-..., 1-2, 2-3.
    Actually the Alt loop: 10->8 (long), 8->6, 6->4, 4->5, 5->1, 1->2 (medium), 2->3 (medium), 3->9, 9->7, 7->10.
    My loop edges: 10->2 (medium), 2->8 (short), 1->3 (short).
    Alt loop edges: 10->8 (long), 1->2 (medium), 2->3 (medium).
    
    Comparing lengths:
    My Loop: d(10,2) + d(2,8) + d(1,3)
    Alt Loop: d(10,8) + d(1,2) + d(2,3)
    
    Visually:
    d(10,8) is the distance between the two top "peaks". It looks longer than d(10,2).
    d(2,8) is very short.
    d(1,3) is very short.
    d(1,2) is medium (vertical separation).
    d(2,3) is medium (diagonal).
    
    My Loop sum = Medium + Short + Short.
    Alt Loop sum = Long + Medium + Medium.
    
    My loop is clearly shorter. The connection 2-8 is a key short edge that should be utilized. The connection 1-3 is a key short edge.
    My loop uses both. The Alt loop breaks both (going 1-2 and 2-3 and 8-10 skips 2-8 and 1-3).
    
    So 10->2->8 is correct.

    Answer: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5

    Re-verifying the example format.
    Example: 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6
    Just a list of numbers.

    The path is:
    1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> (1)

    Output string: 1, 3, 9, 7, 10, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5
