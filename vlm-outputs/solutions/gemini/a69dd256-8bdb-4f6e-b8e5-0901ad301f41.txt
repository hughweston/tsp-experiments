Based on a visual analysis of the point distribution to determine the shortest path, here is the optimal tour. I will start from the top-leftmost cluster and work my way around the loop.

1.  Start with point **1** in the upper left.
2.  Move to the nearby point **10**.
3.  Then go down to **19**.
4.  Travel down towards the bottom left cluster, hitting **5**.
5.  Move right to **4**.
6.  Very close to 4 is **20**.
7.  Move slightly up and right to **8**.
8.  Immediately next to 8 is **13**.
9.  Go up to point **3**.
10. Then drop down to the lowest point in this area, **14**.
11. Traverse the long gap to the right to reach **16**.
12. Continue right to **9**.
13. Move slightly up and right to **11**.
14. Go to the far right point **17**.
15. Loop back left and upwards to **12**.
16. Continue up and left to **2**.
17. Move left to **18**.
18. Go slightly down and left to **7**.
19. Move up and left to **15**.
20. Finally, go to point **6**, which closes the loop back to point 1.

**Tour:**
1, 10, 19, 5, 4, 20, 8, 13, 3, 14, 16, 9, 11, 17, 12, 2, 18, 7, 15, 6
