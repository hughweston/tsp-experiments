To find the shortest path, let's analyze the spatial distribution of the points and trace the most logical loop that minimizes distance (avoiding crossing lines).

1.  **Analyze the clusters:**
    *   There is a left-most cluster: Points 2, 5, 6.
    *   There is a central group: Points 7, 3, 4.
    *   There is a right-most cluster: Points 9, 8, 1, 10.

2.  **Trace the path:**
    *   Let's start at the far right bottom, at point **10**.
    *   The closest neighbor to 10 is clearly **1**.
    *   From 1, the next logical step up the right side is **8**.
    *   From 8, continue moving up to **9**.
    *   From 9, we need to cross over to the central/left area. The most direct path is towards the top-middle point, **4**.
    *   From 4, move down slightly to **3**.
    *   From 3, the next closest point to the left is **7**.
    *   From 7, move to the left-most cluster. The closest point is **6**.
    *   From 6, go to the nearby point **5**.
    *   From 5, go up to the top-left point **2**.
    *   From 2, to close the loop, we would need to go back across to the right side (towards 9 or 4), but since we are listing a sequence, we just need to ensure the ends connect logically. A path from 2 back to 4 or 9 would complete a loop, but looking at the overall shape, the path 2 -> 4 is quite long. Let's re-evaluate the connection between the left and right sides.

    *Alternative Loop check:*
    Maybe the loop is circular.
    Start at **2** -> **5** -> **6** -> **7** -> **3** -> **1**? No, 1 is too far. **3** -> **1** crosses the whole graph.
    Let's look at the "bottom" arc vs the "top" arc.
    Bottom arc: **10** -> **1** -> **8** -> **3**? No, 8 is closer to 9.
    Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep.
    Start bottom right: **10**.
    Go up: **1** -> **8** -> **9**.
    Go left: **4** (top middle).
    Go left: **2** (top left).
    Go down: **5** -> **6**.
    Go right: **7**.
    Go right/up: **3**.
    From **3**, we need to get back to the start (**10** or **1**).
    Distance 3 -> 1 is moderately long but likely the best link to close the loop on the bottom. Or distance 3 -> 8.
    Let's look at the gap between the middle and right clusters again.
    3 is quite close to 8 and 1.
    4 is close to 9.

    Let's try this path:
    **10** -> **1** -> **8** -> **9** -> **4** -> **2** -> **5** -> **6** -> **7** -> **3** -> (back to 1, or 8, or 10).
    The jump 4 -> 2 is very long.
    The jump 3 -> 1 is reasonable.
    The jump 9 -> 4 is reasonable.
    Is there a better way to handle the left side?
    Maybe **4** -> **3** -> **7** -> **6** -> **5** -> **2**?
    Then from 2, we have a very long jump back to the right side (to 9 or 4).

    Let's reconsider the middle connections.
    The points are roughly arranged in a "U" shape or a squashed circle.
    Top edge: 2 ... 4 ... 9
    Bottom/Middle edge: 5-6-7-3 ... 8-1-10

    Let's try tracing the perimeter:
    Start **10**.
    Go to **1**.
    Go to **8**.
    Go to **3**? (3 is horizontally aligned with 8).
    Go to **7**.
    Go to **6**.
    Go to **5**.
    Go to **2**.
    From 2, cross to **4**.
    From 4, cross to **9**.
    From 9, go down to **8**? No, we already visited 8.
    This creates a crossing.

    Let's try a zig-zag or strip approach.
    Right side: 10, 1, 8, 9. These form a line.
    Middle: 3, 4.
    Left side: 2, 5, 6, 7.

    Let's try to connect neighbors strictly.
    2 is isolated. Its only real neighbor is 5 (or 4 far away). So the path must include ...4-2-5... or ...5-2-4...
    Let's assume **4 -> 2 -> 5**.
    From 5, closest is **6**. So **5 -> 6**.
    From 6, closest is **7**. So **6 -> 7**.
    From 7, closest is **3**. So **7 -> 3**.
    Now we are at 3. Where to go?
    Closest unvisited points to 3 are 4 (visited), 8, 1.
    If we connect **3 -> 8**.
    From 8, closest are 9 and 1.
    If we go **8 -> 9**.
    From 9, we need to close the loop back to start. We have visited 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 8, 9.
    Remaining: 1, 10.
    We are at 9. Closest unvisited is... well, 9 is at the top. 1 and 10 are at the bottom.
    So maybe **8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, we need to close the loop to the start (which was 4).
    Is 10 -> 4 a good edge? No, it's huge and crosses everything.

    Let's re-route the right side.
    We entered from the left at 3.
    **3 -> 8** seems good.
    From 8, go down to **1**, then **10**.
    From 10, we need to go to **9** to pick it up? 10 -> 9 is a long span across 1 and 8.
    Better path on right side: **3 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10** (stuck at bottom) OR **3 -> 1 -> 10** (stuck at bottom).
    How about **3 -> 8 -> 9**? From 9, we must go to **10**? Long jump.
    What if the right side is traversed as **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**?
    Then the loop closure is 10 -> back to left side?
    Or **10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9**.
    From 9, go to **4**.
    From 4, go to **3**? No, 4 and 3 are vertically aligned.
    Let's try the loop:
    **9 -> 4 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2**.
    Now from 2, we need to get back to the 10-1-8 group.
    2 is far top-left.
    This implies the connection must be 2 -> something on right? No, 2 -> 4 is the only "top" connection.
    So the sequence 2-4-9 seems robust for the top edge.
    Let's try: **2 -> 4 -> 9**.
    From 9, go down to **8**.
    From 8, go down to **1**.
    From 1, go down to **10**.
    From 10, we need to go left. The closest point on the left "bottom" track is **3**? No, 3 is higher.
    Actually, looking at the coordinates:
    10 is very low.
    1 is low.
    8 is mid-low.
    3 is mid-low.
    7 is mid-low.
    6 is mid-low.
    5 is mid.
    2 is high.
    4 is high.
    9 is high.

    This suggests a loop around the perimeter.
    Top edge: **2 -> 4 -> 9**.
    Right edge going down: **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    Bottom return path: **10 -> ... -> 2**.
    From 10, the next point to the left is **3**? Distance 10-3 is far.
    Maybe **10 -> 3** is not the link.
    Let's look at 1 and 3. Distance 1-3 is closer than 10-3.
    Let's look at 8 and 3. Distance 8-3 is closest.
    So the link between right and middle clusters is likely at 3-8 or 4-9.
    Since 4 and 9 are high, and 3 and 8 are mid, let's look at the structure again.
    
    It looks like two parallel vertical lines? No.
    It looks like a big "C" shape or circle.
    
    Let's try to follow the "circle" of points counter-clockwise:
    Start at **10**.
    Go to **1**.
    Go to **8**.
    Go to **3**. (8 and 3 are closest neighbors between the clusters).
    Go to **7**.
    Go to **6**.
    Go to **5**.
    Go to **2**.
    Go to **4**.
    Go to **9**.
    From 9, close loop to **10**.
    Distance 9 -> 10 is very large. This is not the shortest tour. The gap 9-10 is the entire height of the right side.

    Correction: The right side points are 9 (top), 8, 1, 10 (bottom).
    The best way to visit a line of points is in order. 9-8-1-10.
    So we enter the right cluster at 9 or 10.
    
    Case A: Enter at 9 (from 4).
    Path: ... -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10 -> ...
    From 10, we need to go back to the left.
    The closest point to 10 on the left is **3**? No, it's quite far.
    Actually, let's look at **3**. It's below 4.
    Is it better to go **4 -> 3**? They are very close.
    If we connect 4-3, then we split the graph into Left (2,5,6,7) and Right (9,8,1,10).
    
    Let's try a path that weaves:
    **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, return to 2. That's a huge diagonal. Bad.
    
    Let's try turning around at the ends.
    Start at **2**.
    Go **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7**.
    From 7, go to **3**.
    From 3, go to **8**? (Crosses gap).
    From 8, go to **1 -> 10**.
    From 10... stuck.
    
    Let's look at **3**. It's a hub.
    Neighbors of 3: 4 (above), 7 (left), 8 (right).
    Neighbors of 4: 3 (below), 2 (left-ish), 9 (right).
    
    So the "bridge" between left and right is the 3/4 pair.
    The left loop is 2-5-6-7.
    The right loop is 9-8-1-10.
    We need to splice these.
    
    Path segment 1: **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3**.
    From 3, we can go to 8 (right) or 4 (up).
    
    Option 1: Go **3 -> 8**.
    Then traverse right side: **8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, we must go up to **9**. (10->9 is long, but 10->1->8->9 is better, but we already visited 8 and 1).
    So if we enter at 8, we should probably go down then up?
    **3 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**... dead end.
    **3 -> 1 -> 10**... then to 8? 10->8 crosses 1.
    
    Let's look at the right side geometry again.
    10, 1, 8, 9 are almost collinear. The best way to traverse them is 10-1-8-9 or 9-8-1-10.
    So we must enter at one end and leave at the other.
    Let's enter at 10 (from the left? No, 10 is far from left).
    Let's enter at 9 (from 4).
    So: **4 -> 9**.
    Then **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, we need to return to the left side.
    The closest point to 10 on the left is **3**.
    So **10 -> 3**.
    Then from 3, go to **7**.
    Then **7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2**.
    From 2, close loop to **4**.
    
    Let's check the edge lengths for this tour:
    **4 -> 9**: Moderate.
    **9 -> 8**: Short.
    **8 -> 1**: Short.
    **1 -> 10**: Short.
    **10 -> 3**: Long. This is the suspicious link.
    **3 -> 7**: Moderate/Short.
    **7 -> 6**: Short.
    **6 -> 5**: Short.
    **5 -> 2**: Moderate.
    **2 -> 4**: Very Long. (2 is top left, 4 is top middle).
    
    Is there a better way?
    What if we swap the 3/4 traversal?
    Come from right side into 3, go up to 4, then left?
    Path: **10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9**. (Enter bottom, leave top).
    From 9, go to **4**.
    From 4, go to **2**. (Long).
    From 2, go **5 -> 6 -> 7**.
    From 7, go to **3**.
    From 3, close loop to **10**.
    This has two long links: 4->2 and 3->10.
    
    Let's try to eliminate the 4->2 long link.
    We can go **4 -> 3**. They are neighbors.
    Then **3 -> 7**.
    Then **7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2**.
    From 2, we need to cross to the right side.
    **2 -> 9** is huge.
    This implies 2 must connect to 4 or 5.
    If 2 connects to 5 (it does), and 2 connects to 4?
    If 2 connects to 4, that's a long top edge.
    Is there any node between 2 and 4? No.
    So 2-4 is likely an edge, unless the path snakes through the middle.
    Could it be **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...**?
    Yes.
    Now from 4, where to?
    To **9**.
    Then **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, return to **2**? No. Return to **start**.
    If start was 2, loop is 2...10-2. That's a diagonal across the whole map.
    
    Let's re-examine the connection between the {2,5,6,7,3,4} group and the {9,8,1,10} group.
    Connections:
    4 - 9 (Top)
    3 - 8 (Middle)
    
    If we use both bridges (4-9 and 3-8), we avoid the long diagonals at the bottom or top.
    Let's try to construct a loop using bridges 4-9 and 3-8.
    
    Sequence:
    ... -> **4 -> 9** -> (traverse right side) -> **8 -> 3** -> (traverse left side) -> **4** ...
    
    Let's traverse the right side starting at 9 and ending at 8.
    **9 -> ... -> 8**.
    This would be **9 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8**? No, 9 is top, 10 is bottom.
    It would be **9 -> ... -> 10 ... -> 8**.
    But 8 is between 9 and 1.
    So we can't go 9 -> end -> 8 easily without skipping and doubling back.
    Unless... **9 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8**?
    9 to 10 is a huge jump.
    
    What about **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**?
    Then we are at 10. We need to get back to the left side.
    We decided 10->3 is long.
    Is 10->7 shorter? No.
    Is 10->6 shorter? No.
    What about the other bridge?
    We proposed **4-9** and **3-8**.
    If we enter right side at 9, and want to leave at 8, we have a problem because 8 is adjacent to 9.
    
    Wait, look at point 3.
    It is close to 8.
    It is close to 4.
    It is close to 7.
    
    Look at point 8.
    It is close to 9.
    It is close to 1.
    It is close to 3.
    
    Maybe the loop crosses at **4-9** and **10-?** No.
    Maybe the loop crosses at **3-8**?
    Let's assume the path segments are:
    Left Cluster: 2-5-6-7-3-4 (in some order)
    Right Cluster: 9-8-1-10 (in some order)
    
    Let's optimize the Right Cluster.
    We need to enter at one point and leave at another.
    Points are roughly on a line. 9-8-1-10.
    The most efficient way is to enter at an end (9 or 10) and leave at the other (10 or 9).
    This implies the connections to the rest of the graph are at 9 and 10.
    Connection 1: **9 -> 4**. (This looks like a solid candidate).
    Connection 2: **10 -> ?**.
    We need a connection from 10 to the left cluster.
    Candidates on left: 3, 7, 6, 5, 2.
    Visually, 3 is the closest to 10. Or maybe 10 loops all the way back to 2? No.
    If 10 connects to 3, the edge **10-3** is long.
    Let's check if there is a better configuration.
    
    What if the right cluster is NOT visited in a straight line?
    e.g. **3 -> 8 -> 9 -> ... -> 1 -> 10 -> ...**
    Say we cross at 3-8.
    Go **3 -> 8**.
    From 8, go **9**. (Up).
    From 9, go **4**. (Left).
    Now we are on the left side. **4**.
    Traverse left side down to a point that connects to 1 or 10?
    **4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7**.
    Now we are at 7.
    We need to connect 7 to the remaining right-side points (1, 10).
    Wait, we did 3->8->9... so 1 and 10 are unvisited.
    This path is broken.
    
    Let's try again.
    Bridge **3 -> 8**.
    From 8, we have 9 (up) and 1 (down).
    Let's go down. **8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, we are at a dead end. We need to jump somewhere.
    Jump to **9**? (Long).
    Jump to **7**? (Long).
    Jump to **6**? (Long).
    
    Maybe the "line" 9-8-1-10 is not a line in the TSP tour.
    Maybe it's **9-8** and **1-10** as separate segments?
    e.g. **4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2 -> ... -> 10 -> 1 -> ...**?
    From 2 to 10 is huge.
    From 2 to 1 is huge.
    From 2, we must go to 5 or 4.
    Since 5 is taken, 2 must connect to 4.
    So the segment is **... -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> ...**
    From 4, we go to **9**.
    So **... -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> ...**
    From 8, we go to **3**.
    So **... -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> ...**
    From 3, we go to **7**.
    **... -> 8 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> ...** (Loop closed!)
    Let's trace this entire loop and see what's missing.
    Loop: **2 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2**.
    Missing points: **1, 10**.
    Where do 1 and 10 fit?
    They are hanging off the bottom of 8.
    The closest point to 1 is 8.
    The closest point to 10 is 1.
    So we need to insert 1 and 10 into the sequence near 8.
    The sequence near 8 is **... -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> ...**
    Can we do **9 -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> 3**?
    9->1 is a skip over 8. Distance is okay.
    1->10 is good.
    10->8 is a skip over 1. Distance is okay.
    8->3 is good.
    So path: **... 4 -> 9 -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> 3 ...**
    Let's check 9 -> 1 vs 9 -> 8. 9->8 is much shorter.
    Let's check 10 -> 8 vs 1 -> 8. 1->8 is much shorter.
    This insertion adds a lot of distance (crossings).
    
    Is there a way to append 1-10 at the end of the chain?
    Sequence: **3 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, we need to go to somewhere.
    If we go **10 -> 7**? Long.
    If we go **10 -> 3**? Long.
    
    Let's reconsider the **10 -> 3** link.
    It seems unavoidable if we do a full perimeter loop.
    Let's visualize the "convex hull" ish tour.
    Points: 2, 4, 9, 8, 1, 10, 3, 7, 6, 5.
    If we connect them in that order:
    2 -> 4: Good.
    4 -> 9: Good.
    9 -> 8: Good.
    8 -> 1: Good.
    1 -> 10: Good.
    10 -> 3: The problematic long edge.
    3 -> 7: Good.
    7 -> 6: Good.
    6 -> 5: Good.
    5 -> 2: Good.
    
    Is there any other link that crosses the gap shorter than 10-3?
    What about **1-3**?
    Path: ... **8 -> 9 ...** No, 8 is below 9.
    Path: **... 9 -> 8 -> 10 -> 1 -> 3 ...**?
    8->10 skips 1.
    10->1 backtracks.
    1->3 is a shorter bridge than 10-3.
    Distance 1-3 looks comparable to 3-8.
    So: **... -> 9 -> 8 -> 10 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...**
    Let's check 8->10. It's longer than 8->1.
    But it saves us the 10->3 return.
    Let's compare:
    Option A: **8 -> 1 -> 10 -> 3**. (Standard chain, long return).
    Option B: **8 -> 10 -> 1 -> 3**. (Skip 1, short return from 1).
    Visual check:
    8->1 is dist X.
    1->10 is dist Y.
    10->3 is dist Z (Long).
    Total: X + Y + Z.
    
    8->10 is dist ~X+Y (slightly less, straight line).
    10->1 is dist Y.
    1->3 is dist W (W < Z).
    Total: (X+Y) + Y + W.
    Is 2Y + W + X < X + Y + Z?
    Y + W < Z?
    Y is short (1-10). W is moderate (1-3). Z is long (10-3).
    Visually, 1, 10, 3 form a triangle. 1-10 + 1-3 vs 10-3.
    Triangle inequality says 1-10 + 1-3 > 10-3.
    So Option A is shorter locally.
    Wait, this logic works if 1 is between 10 and 3. It's not.
    10 is at the bottom. 1 is above it. 3 is to the left of 1.
    Angle 10-1-3 is obtuse.
    So 10-3 is likely the longest side.
    10-1 + 1-3 is longer than 10-3.
    So going via 1 (10->1->3) is longer than direct (10->3).
    BUT we need to visit 1.
    If we do 8->1->10->3, we travel 8-1, 1-10, 10-3.
    If we do 8->10->1->3, we travel 8-10, 10-1, 1-3.
    8-10 is roughly 8-1 + 1-10.
    So 8-10 is roughly 8-1 + 1-10.
    Comparing (8-1 + 1-10 + 10-1 + 1-3) vs (8-1 + 1-10 + 10-3).
    Roughly (A + B + B + C) vs (A + B + D).
    We are comparing B+C vs D.
    B is 1-10 (short). C is 1-3 (moderate). D is 10-3 (long).
    1-10 + 1-3 vs 10-3.
    Visually, 1 is somewhat "on the way" between 10 and 3, but pushed to the right.
    Actually 1 is to the right of the line 10-3.
    So 10-1-3 bends outwards. 10-3 is straighter.
    However, we must visit 1.
    In the sequence 8->1->10, we are going down. Then 10->3 goes up-left.
    This creates a sharp "V" turn at 10.
    In the sequence 8->10->1, we go down past 1, then up to 1, then left to 3.
    8->10 passes 1.
    10->1 backtracks up.
    1->3 goes left.
    This seems to involve more backtracking.
    
    Let's check if there's an alternative to the 10-3 link.
    Is it possible to go **3 -> 1 -> 10** then **10 -> 7**? No, 7 is higher.
    What about **3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8**?
    3 -> 10 is the long link.
    10 -> 1 is short.
    1 -> 8 is short.
    This is just the reverse.
    
    Is it possible to connect **10 -> 6** or **10 -> 7**?
    7 is much higher than 10.
    6 is higher than 10.
    3 is closest vertically, although horizontally separated.
    
    Let's look at the entire map again.
    Are 5, 6, 7, 3 collinear?
    5-6-7-3 looks like a smooth curve.
    Are 2, 4, 9 collinear?
    2-4-9 looks like a smooth curve.
    
    This strongly suggests the "C" loop.
    Start 2.
    2 -> 5 (Down Left).
    5 -> 6 (Right).
    6 -> 7 (Right).
    7 -> 3 (Right).
    3 -> 1? Or 3 -> 8?
    3 and 1 are at similar Y level? No, 1 is lower.
    3 and 8 are at similar Y level.
    So **3 -> 8** is a horizontal continuation.
    From 8, we can go up to 9 or down to 1.
    If we go up to **9**: **8 -> 9**.
    Then from 9 we must go to **4** (Left).
    Then **4 -> 2**. Loop Closed.
    BUT we missed 1 and 10.
    So at 8, we must detour to 1 and 10.
    Can we insert 1 and 10 between 8 and 9?
    Path: ... **3 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10 -> 9 -> 4** ...
    1 -> 10 is down.
    10 -> 9 is huge up. Bad.
    
    Can we insert 1 and 10 at the end of the chain?
    Path: ... **3 -> 8 -> 9**. (Now at top right).
    We need to visit 1 and 10 and get back to 4.
    **9 -> 1 -> 10 -> 4**? Terrible.
    
    Can we do the detour at the bottom?
    Path: ... **7 -> 3**.
    Instead of 3->8, go **3 -> 1**.
    **3 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, go to **8**. (Up).
    From 8, go to **9**. (Up).
    From 9, go to **4**. (Left).
    From 4, go to **2**. (Left).
    From 2, go to **5**. (Down).
    From 5, go to **6**. (Right).
    From 6, go to **7**. (Right).
    From 7, go to **3**. (Right).
    
    Let's evaluate this loop: **3 -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3**.
    Segments:
    3 -> 1: Moderate length. 3 is (x3, y3), 1 is (x1, y1). Gap is noticeable.
    1 -> 10: Short.
    10 -> 8: Moderate. (Skips 1).
    8 -> 9: Short.
    9 -> 4: Moderate.
    4 -> 2: Long.
    2 -> 5: Moderate.
    5 -> 6: Short.
    6 -> 7: Short.
    7 -> 3: Short.
    
    Let's compare with the previous loop:
    **10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 10**.
    This one has the **3 -> 10** long link.
    The new one has **3 -> 1** (shorter than 3-10) and **10 -> 8** (longer than 1-8).
    Let's verify geometry.
    1, 8, 10 are on a line. 1 is between 8 and 10.
    So **10 -> 8** is approx **10->1** + **1->8**.
    So the cost of detour **1->10->8** is 2 * dist(1,10) + dist(1,8).
    Normal path **1->8** cost is dist(1,8).
    So extra cost is 2 * dist(1,10).
    The saving is replacing **3->10** with **3->1**.
    Is dist(3,10) - dist(3,1) > 2 * dist(1,10)?
    Visually: 1 is closer to 3 than 10 is. But 10 is just below 1.
    The distance 3->10 and 3->1 are the hypotenuses.
    Horizontal dist to line 1-10 is large. Vertical diff is small.
    So 3->1 and 3->10 are likely very similar in length.
    If 3->1 and 3->10 are similar, then adding the detour cost 2*dist(1,10) makes the detour path worse.
    So the sequence **10 -> 1 -> 8** (visiting in order) is better than **1 -> 10 -> 8**.
    
    This confirms the sequence on the right should be monotonic: 10-1-8-9 or 9-8-1-10.
    
    So we are back to the standard perimeter loop:
    **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2**
    Wait, **3 -> 10**?
    Let's check **3 -> 1**.
    If we do **3 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9**. We skip 10.
    We must include 10. 10 is a leaf off 1.
    So either 10 is between 1 and something else, or it's an endpoint.
    If 10 is an endpoint of the right-side chain, the link must be to 10.
    So it has to be **... -> 3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> ...**
    Wait, why not **... -> 3 -> 1 -> 10**... dead end?
    Unless we double back? No, TSP is simple cycle.
    
    Is it possible 10 connects to something else?
    What about **6 -> 10**? No.
    The only feasible neighbors for 10 are 1 and 3.
    (And maybe 7, but 3 is closer).
    If 10 connects to 1 and 3, then the path is **3 -> 10 -> 1**.
    This segment **3-10-1** replaces **3-1**? Or **3-?-1**?
    If we didn't go to 10, we'd go 3->...->1.
    So 3->10->1->8->9... looks like a valid sequence.
    Let's check the cost of **3 -> 10**.
    It is a diagonal.
    Is it shorter than **3 -> 8**?
    3 and 8 are horizontally aligned. 3 and 10 are diagonal.
    3-8 is definitely shorter than 3-10.
    
    Let's consider the cross-over **3 -> 8**.
    If we cross **3 -> 8**.
    We are at 8. Unvisited: 1, 10, 9.
    We can go **8 -> 9**.
    Then we have isolated 1, 10.
    We can go **8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    Then we are at 10. We must return to the left side (or top).
    Return to **4**? (From 10). Very long.
    Return to **2**? Very long.
    This implies if we cross at 3-8, we get stuck at 10.
    
    Unless... we cross back?
    Maybe the loop is a figure 8? No, simple cycle.
    
    What if the top bridge is not 4-9?
    What if it is **2 -> 9**? No, longer.
    What if it is **4 -> 8**? No.
    
    Let's reconsider the **10 -> 3** link.
    Is there any other node 10 could connect to?
    Maybe **7**?
    10 is bottom right. 7 is bottom-ish middle.
    Path **10 -> 7** crosses 3?
    Points are 7, 3. 3 is to the right of 7.
    So 10 is to the right of 3.
    So sequence 7-3-10 makes sense spatially.
    Sequence 10-7 would cross 3 (or go under it).
    So **3** is the gateway to **10**.
    
    Therefore, the connection must be **3 - 10** or **3 - 1**.
    If **3 - 1**:
    Then we have **3 -> 1**.
    From 1, we must go to 10 (since 10 is a dead end otherwise). **1 -> 10**.
    From 10, where?
    We must leave 10.
    Closest neighbor to 10 (besides 1) is... nobody.
    Wait, that means 10 must be connected to 1 and... ?
    In a TSP, every node has degree 2.
    So 10 must have 2 edges.
    One edge is clearly **10-1**.
    What is the other edge?
    It has to be **10-3** or **10-7** or **10-8** (skipping 1).
    Distance 10-3 is long.
    Distance 10-8 is moderate (skips 1).
    Distance 10-7 is long.
    Distance 10-6 is very long.
    Distance 10-9 is very long.
    So the second edge for 10 is likely **10-3** or **10-8**.
    
    Case 1: Edges are **1-10** and **10-8**.
    Path segment: **1 - 10 - 8**.
    This means we visit 1, go to 10, go to 8.
    This is a little "detour" triangle on the side.
    Order: ... -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> ...
    Or: ... -> 8 -> 10 -> 1 -> ...
    This preserves the vertical flow on the right side.
    If we do **1 -> 10 -> 8**, we then need to connect 8 and 1 to the rest.
    So **... -> ? -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> ? -> ...**
    Neighbors of 8: 9, 3.
    Neighbors of 1: 3. (And 8, but we used 8-10-1 not 8-1).
    So we could have:
    **3 -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> ...**
    Let's evaluate this.
    **3 -> 1**: Moderate.
    **1 -> 10**: Short.
    **10 -> 8**: Moderate.
    **8 -> 9**: Short.
    **9 -> 4**: Moderate.
    **4 -> 2**: Long.
    **2 -> 5**: Moderate.
    **5 -> 6**: Short.
    **6 -> 7**: Short.
    **7 -> 3**: Short.
    
    Let's compare this to the "standard" perimeter loop:
    **3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> ...**
    Links:
    **3 -> 10**: Long.
    **10 -> 1**: Short.
    **1 -> 8**: Short.
    **8 -> 9**: Short.
    
    Compare (3->1 + 1->10 + 10->8) vs (3->10 + 10->1 + 1->8).
    3->1 is shorter than 3->10.
    1->10 is same.
    10->8 is longer than 1->8.
    
    Visual check:
    Triangle 1-8-10.
    1-8 is a leg. 1-10 is a leg. 8-10 is hypotenuse-ish.
    So 1-8 + 1-10 > 8-10? Yes triangle inequality.
    Wait, if 1-8 + 1-10 > 8-10, then the path 8-10 is shorter than 8-1-10.
    So traversing the "V" 8-1-10 directly (8->10) saves distance compared to going through the vertex 1?
    No, we have to visit 1.
    We are comparing sequences:
    S1: Enter 1, go 10, go 8. (Edges: X-1, 1-10, 10-8, 8-Y).
    S2: Enter 10, go 1, go 8. (Edges: X-10, 10-1, 1-8, 8-Y).
    
    Let X = 3. Let Y = 9.
    S1: 3-1, 1-10, 10-8, 8-9.
    S2: 3-10, 10-1, 1-8, 8-9.
    Common parts: 8-9.
    Compare: (3-1 + 1-10 + 10-8) vs (3-10 + 10-1 + 1-8).
    Remove 1-10: Compare (3-1 + 10-8) vs (3-10 + 1-8).
    
    Look at quadrilateral 3-1-8-10.
    3 is top-left.
    1 is bottom-right (inner).
    8 is top-right (inner).
    10 is bottom-right (outer).
    
    Actually, 8 is above 1. 1 is above 10.
    3 is to the left of the 8-1 gap.
    
    Distances:
    3-1 and 3-8 look similar. Let's say 3-8 is slightly shorter.
    10-8 is definitely longer than 1-8. (1 is between 8 and 10).
    3-10 is definitely longer than 3-1. (10 is further down).
    
    Let's check the terms again.
    S1 cost: (3-1) + (10-8). Moderate + Moderate.
    S2 cost: (3-10) + (1-8). Long + Short.
    
    Let's try to put numbers on it (pixel coordinates estimation).
    Let 3 = (300, 300).
    Let 8 = (500, 300).
    Let 1 = (510, 400).
    Let 10 = (550, 500).
    
    Distances:
    3-8: 200.
    3-1: sqrt(210^2 + 100^2) = sqrt(44100+10000) = 232.
    3-10: sqrt(250^2 + 200^2) = sqrt(62500+40000) = 320.
    1-8: sqrt(10^2 + 100^2) = 100.5.
    1-10: sqrt(40^2 + 100^2) = 107.
    10-8: sqrt(50^2 + 200^2) = 206.
    
    S1 (3-1-10-8): 232 + 107 + 206 = 545.
    S2 (3-10-1-8): 320 + 107 + 100.5 = 527.5.
    
    S2 seems shorter!
    Why? Because 3-10 is long, but 3-1 + 10-8 involves a "cross back". 10 is far, so going 3-1 (part way) then 10-8 (long way back) is costly.
    Going 3-10 (all the way) then 10-1-8 (smooth return) is better.
    Wait, 3-10 is the diagonal.
    3-1 is a shorter diagonal.
    10-8 is a double segment length roughly.
    1-8 is single segment.
    So we compare: ShortDiag + DoubleSeg vs LongDiag + SingleSeg.
    Typically LongDiag < ShortDiag + Seg.
    So S2 is better.
    
    Let's verify the S2 path: **... -> 7 -> 3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> ...**
    Visually:
    We come from left (7). Go to 3.
    Go deep to 10.
    Come back up through 1 to 8.
    Continue up to 9.
    Cross to 4.
    
    Is there a better option S3?
    S3: **3 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    Then from 10... we have to go back to start.
    If start is 2, loop is ...10-2. (Huge diagonal).
    If loop is 10-7 (Huge diagonal).
    So S3 is not a loop candidate unless we find a closing link.
    Is **10 -> 3** valid closing link?
    Yes, that's just S2 reversed.
    **4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10 -> 3 -> 7 ...**
    This looks like the winner.
    
    Let's double check the **4 -> 2** link.
    Is there any way to avoid it?
    We have end points 2 and 4.
    We need to connect {2,5,6,7,3} to {4,9,8,1,10}.
    Wait, 4 is in the left group or right group?
    Geometrically 4 is top-center.
    It is close to 3 (below) and 9 (right).
    It is far from 2.
    So maybe 4 belongs to the right group?
    Group A: 2, 5, 6, 7, 3.
    Group B: 4, 9, 8, 1, 10.
    We need 2 bridges between A and B.
    Bridge 1: **3 - 4**. (Very short).
    Bridge 2: **? - ?**.
    Candidates for Bridge 2:
    **2 - 9**? (Long).
    **7 - 10**? (Long).
    **7 - 1**? (Long).
    **3 - 8**? (Short).
    
    If we use bridges **3-4** and **3-8**, then 3 is a hub with 3 connections (7, 4, 8). Not allowed in TSP path.
    So we can't use 3-4 and 3-8 simultaneously.
    
    Path must pass through 3.
    Neighbors of 3 are 7, 4, 8, 1, 10.
    We must pick 2.
    Best 2 neighbors: **7** is very close. **4** is very close.
    If we pick 7 and 4, the path is ...7-3-4...
    Now we are at 4.
    From 4, we must go to {9, 8, 1, 10} or {2, 5, 6}.
    Closest to 4 is **9**.
    So path: **... 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 ...**
    Now we are in right cluster. **9**.
    Go down: **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, we must return to the remaining left cluster nodes {2, 5, 6}.
    We must connect 10 to 2, 5, or 6.
    Closest is **6**? No.
    This creates a massive gap crossing from 10 back to 2/5/6.
    So this bridge choice (3-4 and 10-?) is bad.
    
    Let's try bridges **3-8** and **?**.
    Path passes through 3. Connects 7 and 8?
    **... 7 -> 3 -> 8 ...**
    Now in right cluster. **8**.
    Go down: **8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, stuck.
    Go up: **8 -> 9 -> 4**.
    Now at 4.
    From 4, go to **2**.
    From 2, go to **5 -> 6**.
    From 6, go to **7**. (And 7 connects to 3).
    This closes the loop!
    
    Let's evaluate this loop:
    **3 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3**.
    Wait, where are 1 and 10?
    They are hanging off 8.
    We must insert them.
    As discussed before, inserting 1 and 10 into 3-8-9 path is tricky.
    Sequence: **3 -> 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> 9**?
    Cost: (3-1) + (1-10) + (10-8) + (8-9).
    Vs "standard" perimeter loop:
    **3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9**.
    Cost: (3-10) + (10-1) + (1-8) + (8-9).
    We established earlier that S2 (3-10-1-8) was better than S1 (3-1-10-8).
    Wait, my calc for S2 vs S1 was:
    S1 (3-1-10-8): 545.
    S2 (3-10-1-8): 527.5.
    So **3->10->1->8** is better.
    
    Is there a way to insert 1 and 10 between 8 and 9?
    **8 -> 1 -> 10 -> 9**?
    8-1 (down). 1-10 (down). 10-9 (HUGE up). No.
    
    So the best sequence for the right side seems to be entering at 10 and leaving at 9 (or vice versa).
    Entering at 10 requires the **3->10** link.
    Leaving at 9 connects to **4**.
    
    So the right-side sequence is **3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4**.
    
    Now let's look at the left side.
    We are at 4. We need to visit 2, 5, 6, 7 and return to 3.
    Current ends: 4 and 3.
    Unvisited: 2, 5, 6, 7.
    Best path through them?
    2 is top. 5 is mid. 6 is low. 7 is low.
    4 is top.
    So **4 -> 2**.
    **2 -> 5**.
    **5 -> 6**.
    **6 -> 7**.
    **7 -> 3**.
    This connects perfectly to the 3 from the right side.
    
    Let's verify the **4 -> 2** link again.
    Is there a better way?
    What if we go **4 -> 5**?
    Distance 4-5 vs 4-2.
    4 is (mid, top). 2 is (left, top). 5 is (left, mid).
    2 is closer to the corner. 5 is closer to 4?
    Visually 4-2 looks longer than 4-5?
    Let's check. 4 is at y=~300. 2 is at y=~200. 5 is at y=~400.
    X coords: 2=100, 5=100, 4=300.
    Dist 4-2: dx=200, dy=100 -> 223.
    Dist 4-5: dx=200, dy=100 -> 223.
    Similar.
    
    If we go **4 -> 5**.
    Then from 5 we must go to **2**.
    **5 -> 2**.
    From 2... dead end.
    2 only connects well to 5 and 4.
    If we came from 4, we must go to 2? No, 4->5->2.
    From 2, we must go to **6**?
    2->6 is skipping 5. 5 is between 2 and 6.
    Bad.
    So 2 must be an endpoint of the 2-5-6 chain.
    So we must enter/exit 2 from 4.
    So **4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6**.
    
    So the full sequence is definitively:
    **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2**
    
    Let's double check intersections.
    2-5: vertical-ish.
    5-6: diagonal down-right.
    6-7: diagonal down-right.
    7-3: horizontal right.
    3-10: diagonal down-right.
    10-1: up.
    1-8: up.
    8-9: up.
    9-4: horizontal left.
    4-2: horizontal left.
    
    Does 3-10 cross anything?
    3 is (mid, mid). 10 is (right, bottom).
    7-3 is coming from left.
    The line 3-10 goes down-right.
    The line 10-1 goes up.
    The line 1-8 goes up.
    The line 8-9 goes up.
    The points 1, 8, 9 are to the right of the line 3-10.
    The points 7, 6, 5, 2 are to the left.
    So 3-10 does not cross the vertical column 1-8-9.
    Does it cross 7-3? No, they meet at 3.
    Does it cross 4-9?
    4 is above 3. 9 is above 10.
    Line 3-10 is bottom-left to bottom-right.
    Line 4-9 is top-left to top-right.
    They are roughly parallel. No cross.
    
    Does 4-2 cross anything?
    Top edge. Nothing above it. No cross.
    
    Does 10-1 cross anything?
    It's on the convex hull boundary. No.
    
    What about the ordering 10, 1, 8?
    Is 1 between 10 and 8?
    Yes.
    So 10 -> 8 would skip 1.
    So 10 -> 1 -> 8 is correct.
    
    Is 8 between 1 and 9?
    Yes.
    So 1 -> 9 would skip 8.
    So 1 -> 8 -> 9 is correct.
    
    Is 3 between 7 and 10?
    Spatially yes.
    So 7 -> 10 would skip 3.
    So 7 -> 3 -> 10 is correct.
    
    Is 7 between 6 and 3?
    Yes.
    So 6 -> 3 would skip 7.
    So 6 -> 7 -> 3 is correct.
    
    Is 6 between 5 and 7?
    Yes.
    So 5 -> 7 would skip 6.
    So 5 -> 6 -> 7 is correct.
    
    Is 5 between 2 and 6?
    Yes.
    So 2 -> 6 would skip 5.
    So 2 -> 5 -> 6 is correct.
    
    Is 4 between 2 and 9?
    Spatially, yes.
    So 2 -> 9 would skip 4.
    So 2 -> 4 -> 9 is correct?
    Wait, my previous path was **4 -> 2**.
    Let's check.
    Sequence: 9 -> 4 -> 2.
    Is 4 between 9 and 2?
    9 is right. 2 is left. 4 is middle.
    Yes.
    So 9 -> 2 would skip 4.
    So **9 -> 4 -> 2** is correct.
    
    So the loop is:
    **2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2**
    
    Let's write down the sequence starting from 1 as requested in example format?
    "You can start from any point".
    I will start from 1 for simplicity, or just follow the generated order.
    The example starts with 1.
    Let's start with 1.
    Order: **1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10**.
    Let's verify the loop closure 10 -> 1. Yes.
    
    One final check.
    Is there any weirdness with 8, 9, 4?
    8 is (right, mid). 9 is (right, top). 4 is (mid, top).
    Could it be **8 -> 4 -> 9**?
    8->4 is diagonal. 4->9 is horizontal.
    8->9 is vertical. 9->4 is horizontal.
    Triangle 4-8-9.
    8-4 vs 8-9 + 9-4.
    8-9 is short. 9-4 is moderate. 8-4 is moderate/long.
    Visually 8-9-4 path hugs the convex hull. 8-4 cuts inside.
    Usually convex hull is better.
    So 8 -> 9 -> 4 is better.
    
    Same for 3, 7, 6.
    Any shortcut?
    3 -> 6 skip 7?
    7 is slightly below line 3-6.
    Going 3->7->6 hugs hull. 3->6 cuts inside.
    Hugging hull is usually better.
    
    Same for 2, 5, 6.
    2->6 skip 5?
    5 is slightly left of line 2-6.
    Hugging hull 2->5->6 is better.
    
    Final path seems robust.
    
    Sequence: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.
    
    Let's confirm the prompt: "list of the point labels in the order they should be visited." "Do NOT repeat the first point".
    
    My list: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.
    
    Let's re-verify the 10-3 connection.
    Is it possible that 10 connects to 7?
    Points: 3, 7, 10.
    10 is at (550, 500).
    3 is at (300, 300).
    7 is at (200, 350).
    Dist 10-3: dx=250, dy=200 -> 320.
    Dist 10-7: dx=350, dy=150 -> 380.
    10-3 is shorter.
    
    Is it possible 10 connects to 6?
    6 is at (100, 320).
    Dist 10-6: dx=450... huge.
    
    So 10 connecting to 3 is the only viable option for the return path.
    
    Let's verify 4 -> 2 vs 4 -> 5.
    4 is at (300, 200).
    2 is at (50, 100).
    5 is at (50, 250).
    Dist 4-2: dx=250, dy=100 -> sqrt(62500+10000) = 269.
    Dist 4-5: dx=250, dy=50 -> sqrt(62500+2500) = 255.
    4 -> 5 is actually shorter.
    
    If 4 -> 5 is shorter, let's trace that path.
    **... 9 -> 4 -> 5 ...**
    From 5, we must visit 2 and 6.
    5 is between 2 and 6.
    We are at 5.
    If we go **5 -> 2**. Then from 2, we must go to **6** (skip 5).
    2 is (50, 100). 6 is (100, 320).
    Dist 2-6: dx=50, dy=220 -> 225.
    Total path 4->5->2->6: 255 + 150 (5-2) + 225 = 630.
    
    Compare to 4->2->5->6.
    4->2: 269.
    2->5: 150.
    5->6: dx=50, dy=70 -> 86.
    Total path 4->2->5->6: 269 + 150 + 86 = 505.
    
    505 is much better than 630.
    So despite 4-5 being slightly shorter than 4-2 as an individual edge, the sequence constraint forces a bad jump (2-6) if we go to 5 first.
    So **4 -> 2** is the correct move.
    
    Final check on 10 -> 1 -> 8 vs 1 -> 10 -> 8.
    Coords estimate:
    1 (510, 400). 10 (550, 500). 8 (500, 300).
    1-10: 107.
    10-8: 206.
    Total 1->10->8: 313.
    
    10-1: 107.
    1-8: 100.
    Total 10->1->8: 207.
    
    Huge difference. 207 vs 313.
    So sequence must be **10 -> 1 -> 8**.
    
    So the path is definitively:
    **10, 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3**. (And back to 10).
    
    Start point in list: I'll pick 2 just to follow the "left-to-right" reading or 1 because it's number 1.
    The prompt example starts with 1. I will provide the list starting with 1.
    
    List: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Double check the image labels.
    Left cluster: 2 (top), 5 (mid), 6 (low), 7 (lowest). Wait 7 is lower than 6?
    Let's look closely at 6 and 7.
    6 is left of 7.
    6 looks higher than 7?
    Let's check y-levels.
    2 is highest.
    5 is next.
    6 is next.
    7 is next (lower).
    3 is maybe slightly higher than 7?
    If 7 is the lowest point in that dip, then 6->7->3 is correct "U" shape.
    Let's check 6 vs 7 height.
    6 y-coord looks like ~320.
    7 y-coord looks like ~350.
    So 6 -> 7 goes down.
    7 -> 3 goes up.
    This is consistent with the "U" chain.
    
    What about 5 vs 6?
    5 is higher than 6.
    So 2->5->6->7 (going down and right) is correct.
    
    So the chain 2-5-6-7-3 is correct.
    
    The chain 10-1-8-9 is correct (going up).
    
    The connections 3-10 (bottom return) and 9-4 (top return) and 4-2 (top return) are the logical closers.
    
    Final sequence:
    1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10

    Wait, did I check starting from 2?
    2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10, 1, 8, 9, 4.
    Matches.

    Did I check starting from 4?
    4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10, 1, 8, 9.
    Matches.

    Seems solid.

    One final verification of the visual graph.
    Points:
    2 (top left)
    5 (mid left)
    6 (low mid left)
    7 (low center)
    3 (mid center)
    4 (top center)
    9 (top right)
    8 (mid right)
    1 (low right)
    10 (bottom right)

    Tour:
    2 -> 5: Down-left edge.
    5 -> 6: Short link.
    6 -> 7: Short link.
    7 -> 3: Short link up-right.
    3 -> 10: Long link to bottom-right corner. (Necessary to visit 10/1 cluster).
    10 -> 1: Up link.
    1 -> 8: Up link.
    8 -> 9: Up link.
    9 -> 4: Left link.
    4 -> 2: Left link to start.

    Is there any cross?
    4-2 is top horizontal.
    3-10 is bottom diagonal.
    They don't intersect.
    
    The vertical flows (2-5-6-7 and 9-8-1-10) are on opposite sides.
    3 connects the bottom of left flow to bottom of right flow (via 10).
    4 connects top of right flow to top of left flow (via 2).
    
    Wait, 4 connects 9 to 2.
    So 9 -> 4 -> 2.
    And 3 connects 7 to 10.
    So 7 -> 3 -> 10.
    
    This forms a slightly twisted loop if you imagine 3 and 4 as a vertical bar.
    Left side: 2-5-6-7.
    Right side: 9-8-1-10.
    Connections:
    Top: 2 <-> 4 <-> 9.
    Bottom: 7 <-> 3 <-> 10.
    
    This is a perfect loop. No crossings.
    (Assuming 3-10 doesn't cross 1-8-9 etc, which we verified).
    
    The list is: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Let's start with 2 to be safe, no let's start with 1.
    1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Is it possible the order is reversed?
    1, 10, 3, 7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 9, 8.
    Yes, valid tour in reverse.
    I will provide the counter-clockwise one (as I visualized 10->1->8 going up).
    So 10, 1, 8...
    So starting at 1: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Let's double check if "1" is the bottom-most point on the right?
    No, 10 is clearly lower.
    8 is above 1.
    So the vertical order is 9 (top), 8, 1, 10 (bottom).
    So 1 -> 8 goes UP.
    1 -> 10 goes DOWN.
    If I list 1, 8, 9... I am going UP.
    This corresponds to the direction 10 -> 1 -> 8.
    So 10 is the predecessor of 1.
    
    Correct.

    Final check of the labels in the image.
    Top left: 2.
    Mid left: 5.
    Lower left: 6. (Label 6 is to the right of the dot).
    Bottom mid: 7.
    Center: 3, 4. (4 above 3).
    Right side: 9 (top), 8 (mid), 1 (lower), 10 (bottom).

    Everything matches.

    Final List: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Another look at 1-10 link.
    Label 1 is below the dot.
    Label 8 is above the dot.
    Label 9 is above.
    Label 10 is below.
    
    My spatial analysis holds up.

    Final answer construction.
    Start with 1.
    Next is 8.
    Next is 9.
    Next is 4.
    Next is 2.
    Next is 5.
    Next is 6.
    Next is 7.
    Next is 3.
    Next is 10.
    (Loop back to 1).

    Result: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Wait, what about 2, 4, 3, 7...?
    2 -> 4 (top).
    4 -> 3 (down).
    3 -> 7 (left).
    7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2.
    This is a loop on the left side.
    What about right side?
    This splits the graph into two disconnected loops.
    To merge, we need to break edges.
    Break 4-3 and 2-5? No.
    Break 3-7 and 4-2?
    If we break 4-2, we go 4->9...->10->...->2.
    If we break 3-7, we go 7->...->3.
    This leads back to the main loop I found.
    4->9 connects the groups.
    10->3 connects the groups.
    Or 10->7? No 10-3 is better.
    The logic holds.

    Final check:
    Points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. All present.

    The path follows the perimeter:
    Up the right side (1-8-9).
    Across top (9-4-2).
    Down left side (2-5-6-7).
    Across bottom/middle to close (7-3-10-1).
    Wait, 7->3->10->1?
    7->3 is right.
    3->10 is down-right.
    10->1 is up.
    This is correct.

    Answer: 1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    Let me reconsider the start point. Example starts with 1. I'll stick to that.
    The sequence is robust.

    One tiny detail: Is 6 lower than 5? Yes. Is 7 lower than 6? Yes.
    Is 7 lower than 3? Yes.
    So 2-5-6-7 is monotonic down/right.
    3 is up from 7.
    10 is down from 3?
    3 y-coord ~300. 10 y-coord ~500. Yes.
    So 7 -> 3 -> 10 is a zigzag?
    7 (low) -> 3 (mid) -> 10 (low).
    Why not 7 -> 10 directly?
    Because 3 is in the way / closer to 7?
    Distance 7-3 is small. Distance 3-10 is large.
    Distance 7-10 is large.
    Let's look at 7 -> 10 vs 7 -> 3 -> 10.
    7 is at x=200. 10 is at x=550.
    3 is at x=300.
    Going 7->3 moves x by 100.
    Going 3->10 moves x by 250.
    Going 7->10 moves x by 350.
    Y coords: 7=350, 3=300, 10=500.
    7->10: dx=350, dy=150. L = sqrt(122500+22500) = 380.
    7->3: dx=100, dy=50. L = 111.
    3->10: dx=250, dy=200. L = 320.
    Sum 7-3-10 = 431.
    Direct 7-10 = 380.
    
    So 7->10 is shorter than 7->3->10.
    Does that mean we should skip 3?
    We must visit 3.
    If we do 7->10, where does 3 go?
    ... -> 6 -> 7 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 ...
    Let's check 4->3->2.
    4 is (300, 200). 3 is (300, 300). 2 is (50, 100).
    4->3 is 100.
    3->2: dx=250, dy=200. L=320.
    Total 4->3->2 = 420.
    Original 4->2 = 269.
    Cost increase here is 420 - 269 = 151.
    
    Cost saving on 7-3-10 vs 7-10 was 431 - 380 = 51.
    
    So putting 3 on the 4-2 line is much more expensive than putting 3 on the 7-10 line.
    (Because 3 is "on the way" between 7 and 10 more than it is "on the way" between 4 and 2... wait.
    4 to 2 is top-mid to top-left.
    3 is mid-mid.
    Detouring down to 3 is costly.
    
    7 to 10 is bot-mid to bot-right.
    3 is mid-mid.
    Detouring up to 3 is costly.
    
    However, 3 is very close to 7. (Dist 111).
    Is 3 close to 4?
    4 (300, 200). 3 (300, 300). Dist 100.
    
    So 3 is tightly bound to 4 and 7.
    We must use edges 3-4 and 3-7?
    If we use 3-4 and 3-7:
    Path: ... -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...
    From 4, go to 9? **4 -> 9**.
    From 9, go **9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 10**.
    From 10, go to **2**? (Huge).
    Or from 10 go to **6**? (Huge).
    
    This splits the graph again.
    This implies the bridge must be on 3 or 4, but not the 3-4 edge itself?
    Yes, we must break the 3-4 vertical link to traverse left-right.
    So 3 connects to Left (7) and Right (10).
    4 connects to Left (2) and Right (9).
    This creates the structure:
    Left Loop U-shape (2-5-6-7-3...)
    Right Loop Line (9-8-1-10...)
    Connect 3->10 and 9->4.
    Connect 4->2.
    
    This seems the only topological solution that doesn't involve massive crossing diagonals.
    
    So 3 must connect to 10.
    
    Answer stands.
    1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10.

    One alternative start point just to be sure.
    If I started at 2: 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10, 1, 8, 9, 4.
    
    Looks good.

    Final output generation.
    1, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 10
