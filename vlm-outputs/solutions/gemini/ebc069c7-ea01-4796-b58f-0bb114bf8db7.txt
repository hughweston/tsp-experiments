To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for this set of points, I'll trace a path that connects nearest neighbors to form the shortest possible loop.

Here is the step-by-step route:
1.  Starting at the bottom left with point **10**.
2.  Move to the nearby point **8**.
3.  Continue right to point **2**.
4.  Move up to point **23**.
5.  Move slightly left to point **17**.
6.  Go up to point **14**.
7.  Move further up and left to point **3**.
8.  Go down and right to point **20**.
9.  Continue right to point **1**.
10. Go slightly right and up to point **6**.
11. Move down to point **25**.
12. Go right to point **15**.
13. Move up to point **21**.
14. Go up and left to point **13**.
15. Cross over to the top right to point **16**.
16. Move down to point **19**.
17. Go down to point **22**.
18. Move down and left to point **11**.
19. Move right to point **9**.
20. Continue right to point **4**.
21. Move down to point **18**.
22. Go right to point **7**.
23. Move up to point **24**.
24. Go up to point **5**.
25. Go up to point **12**.
26. (From 12, the loop would naturally return all the way back to the start area, but typically we stop the list here).

Or, tracing another valid local path that might be slightly more optimal in the middle section:
Let's re-evaluate the cluster in the middle.
10 -> 8 -> 2 -> 23 -> 25 -> 15 -> 6 -> 1 -> 14 -> 17 -> (break) -> 20 -> 3 -> 13 -> 21 -> 19 -> 16 -> 12 -> 5 -> 24 -> 7 -> 18 -> 4 -> 9 -> 11 -> 22 -> (back to start region).

Let's try a continuous "outer hull" sweep followed by filling the inside, which is a common heuristic.

**Path Construction:**
- Start bottom left: **10** -> **8**.
- Move east: **8** -> **2**.
- Move north: **2** -> **23**.
- Move slightly west: **23** -> **17**.
- Move north: **17** -> **14**.
- Move north/west: **14** -> **20**.
- Move north/west: **20** -> **3**.
- Move east: **3** -> **13**.
- Move east/north: **13** -> **16**.
- Move east: **16** -> **12**.
- Move south: **12** -> **5**.
- Move south: **5** -> **24**.
- Move south/west: **24** -> **7**.
- Move west: **7** -> **18**.
- Move north/west: **18** -> **4**.
- Move west: **4** -> **9**.
- Move west: **9** -> **11**.
- Move north: **11** -> **22**.
- Move north: **22** -> **19**.
- Move west: **19** -> **21**.
- Move south/west: **21** -> **15**.
- Move west: **15** -> **25**.
- Move north/west: **25** -> **6**.
- Move west: **6** -> **1**.
- Note: From 1, we are close to 14/17/20 which are already visited. We need to connect back to the start (10). The gap is between 1 and 10? No, 1 is near 14.
Let's refine the order to make a single smooth loop without crossing lines.

**Refined Ordering:**
1.  **10** (start)
2.  **17**
3.  **14**
4.  **20**
5.  **3**
6.  **13**
7.  **16**
8.  **12**
9.  **5**
10. **24**
11. **7**
12. **18**
13. **4**
14. **9**
15. **11**
16. **22**
17. **19**
18. **21**
19. **15**
20. **6**
21. **1**
22. **25**
23. **23**
24. **2**
25. **8**
(and 8 connects back to 10).

Let's verify the connections visually:
10->17 is a bit long. 10->8 is better.
Let's try again starting from 8.
8 -> 2 -> 23 -> 25 -> 15 -> 6 -> 1 -> 14 -> 17 -> 10 (Wait, 10 needs to connect to 17 or 8. 10 is isolated on the far left).
Actually, 10 is very close to 8 and 17.
Order: 8 -> 10 -> 17 -> 14 -> 20 -> 3 -> 13 -> 21 -> 19 -> 16 -> 12 -> 5 -> 24 -> 7 -> 18 -> 4 -> 9 -> 11 -> 22 -> 15 -> 6 -> 1 -> 25 -> 23 -> 2 -> (back to 8).
Let's check the crossing between 22->15 and 1->25.
22 is central right. 15 is central. 6 is central. 1 is central left.
11 is below 22.
Path: 11 -> 22 -> 19 -> 21. From 21 (center top), go to 13 (top leftish)? No, 13 is far.
Let's look at the top cluster: 3, 13, 16, 12. These form the top edge.
Let's look at the bottom edge: 10, 8, 2, 23, 11, 9, 18, 7.

**Final Optimized Path:**
1.  **3** (Top Left)
2.  **13**
3.  **16**
4.  **12**
5.  **5**
6.  **24**
7.  **7**
8.  **18**
9.  **4**
10. **9**
11. **11**
12. **22**
13. **19**
14. **21**
15. **15**
16. **25**
17. **23**
18. **2**
19. **8**
20. **10**
21. **17**
22. **14**
23. **1**
24. **6**
25. **20**
(From 20 back to 3 is a short hop).

Let's double check the 1 -> 6 -> 20 segment.
1 is left of 6. 20 is above 1. 3 is above 20.
Path: ...14 -> 1 -> 6 -> 20... -> 3.
Wait, 6 is to the right of 1. 20 is to the left of 6.
Better sequence in that cluster: 17 -> 14 -> 20 -> 3 (top) ... loop around ... -> 21 -> 6 -> 1 -> 25 -> 23 -> 2 -> 8 -> 10 -> 17.
Where does 15 fit? 25 -> 15 -> 22.
Let's re-stitch the middle.
Path coming from right: ...19 -> 22 -> 11 -> 9...
This seems disconnected.
Let's try the "C" shape sweep.
Start 12 (Top Right), down to 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 2, 8, 10, 17, 14, 1, 6, 25, 23 (detour), 15, 22, 19, 21, 13, 3, 20.
Let's refine the bottom left corner.
10 is the tip. 8 and 17 are neighbors.
...11 -> 2 -> 23 -> 25 -> 15...
Wait, 2 to 8 is close. 8 to 10 is close. 10 to 17 is reasonably close.
Let's try:
12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 22, 19, 21, 13, 16 (oops 16 is top), 3, 20, 14, 1, 6, 15, 25, 23, 2, 8, 10, 17... (17 back to start? No).

Let's try this order which looks very clean visually:
Start at **16** (top center).
**16, 12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 2, 8, 10, 17, 14, 20, 3, 13, 21, 19, 22, 15, 6, 1, 25, 23**
From 23, we need to close the loop to 16. That is a long jump.
The gap is between 23 and 11 or 22?
Let's look at 23, 25, 15, 6, 1.
23 is near 25. 25 is near 15. 15 is near 6. 6 is near 1.
1 is near 14.
So: ...17 -> 14 -> 1 -> 6 -> 15 -> 25 -> 23 -> 2...
This connects the left cluster to the bottom cluster well.
How to get from middle to top?
...15 -> 22 -> 19 -> 21 -> 13...
Let's trace:
12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 22, 19, 21, 13, 16 (Top loop done, now to left side) -> 3.
From 3 -> 20.
From 20 -> 14.
From 14 -> 17.
From 17 -> 10.
From 10 -> 8.
From 8 -> 2.
From 2 -> 23.
From 23 -> 25.
From 25 -> 6? Or 1?
25 is close to 15, 6, 1.
Let's try to weave: 23 -> 25 -> 1 -> 6 -> 15.
Then from 15, where to? We need to connect to the 11/22/19 group or the 14/17 group.
Ah, 15 is central.
Let's fix the middle knot: 1, 6, 15, 25, 23.
Sequence: **20, 3, 13, 21, 19, 16, 12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 22, 15, 6, 1, 25, 23, 2, 8, 10, 17, 14**
Does 14 connect back to 20? Yes, they are neighbors.
Let's verify the 22-15-6 segment. 22 to 15 is short. 15 to 6 is short. 6 to 1 is short. 1 to 25 is short. 25 to 23 is short. 23 to 2 is short.
This looks like a very strong candidate for the optimal tour.

**3, 13, 21, 19, 16, 12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 22, 15, 6, 1, 25, 23, 2, 8, 10, 17, 14, 20**
