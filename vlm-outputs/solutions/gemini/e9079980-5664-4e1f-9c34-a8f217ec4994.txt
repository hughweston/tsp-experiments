To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, I will visually trace the shortest path connecting all points, forming a closed loop without crossing itself.

Here is the step-by-step path:

1.  Let's start at the top left with point **18**.
2.  The nearest neighbor to the right is **19**.
3.  From 19, move down towards the central cluster, hitting **4**.
4.  Then to the close neighbor **5**.
5.  Move slightly right to **6**.
6.  Continue right towards the upper-right cluster, reaching **16**.
7.  Go down to **10**.
8.  And immediately to **14** just below it.
9.  Now, head towards the far right group. Visit **2**.
10. Then the very close point **17**.
11. From 17, loop downwards and left to the cluster of three. Visit **15**.
12. Then **3**.
13. Then **12**.
14. Continue moving down to the bottom right points, hitting **20**.
15. Move left to **11**.
16. Continue left across the bottom to **13**.
17. Then to **8**.
18. Move up slightly to **7**.
19. From 7, move up towards the center again to hit **9**.
20. From 9, make the jump left to **1**.
21. Finally, from 1, the path returns to **18** to close the loop (though I won't list 18 again as per instructions).

**The sequence is:**
18, 19, 4, 5, 6, 16, 10, 14, 2, 17, 15, 3, 12, 20, 11, 13, 8, 7, 9, 1
