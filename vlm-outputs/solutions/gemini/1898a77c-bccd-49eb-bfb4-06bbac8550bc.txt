Based on visual inspection to find the shortest path that connects all points and forms a loop (Travelling Salesman Problem), here is the optimal sequence.

I will start with point **1** at the top and generally move clockwise around the outer ring and then sweep through the inner points.

1.  **Start at 1.**
2.  Move down-right to the cluster of points: **9, 7**.
3.  Continue right towards the arc: **24, 6, 13, 18**.
4.  Move down the right edge: **14, 11, 25**.
5.  Continue along the bottom right: **17, 20, 22, 8**.
6.  Move across the bottom: **19, 10, 2, 3**.
7.  Move to the bottom left corner: **23, 15, 5**.
8.  Move up the left side: **12, 4, 21**.
9.  Continue up towards the start: **16**.
10. Finally, from 16, the path closes back to 1.

Let's refine this to ensure the "shortest" path logic, especially around the middle section (points 21, 4, 12).
*   From 3, going to 10 then 19 then across to 23 seems inefficient. A better flow along the bottom is 20 -> 22 -> 17 -> 8 -> 19 -> 2 -> 10 -> 3... wait, 3 is higher up.
*   Let's re-trace a more logical "outer hull then inwards" or a "sweeping" path.

**Revised Path Attempt:**
Start at **1**.
Go to **18** (top right).
Then down the right side: **13, 6, 24** (this is a tight cluster, order 18-13-6-24-7 is messy).
Let's try following the natural curve.

1.  **1**
2.  **9**
3.  **7**
4.  **24**
5.  **6**
6.  **13**
7.  **18**
8.  **14**
9.  **11**
10. **25**
11. **17**
12. **20**
13. **22**
14. **8**
15. **19**
16. **2**
17. **10**
18. **3**
19. **23** (This jump is long). Let's look at the bottom left again.
The sequence 19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 creates a gap to get to 23.
Alternative bottom path: ...8 -> 19 -> 22 -> 20 -> 17... (no).
Let's look at the cluster 3, 2, 10. They are close. The neighbor to the left is 23. The neighbor to the right is 19.
Best local path: ...19 -> 2 -> 10 -> 3... then jump to 21? No, 21 is far.
Maybe: ...19 -> 2 -> 10 -> 23 -> 15 -> 5 -> 12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1... leaving 3 out? No.

Let's try a counter-clockwise sweep starting from 1.
1.  **1**
2.  **16**
3.  **4**
4.  **21** (detour inward)
5.  **12**
6.  **5**
7.  **15**
8.  **23**
9.  **10**
10. **2**
11. **3**
12. **19** (Wait, 3 to 19 is a jump. 10 to 19 is better. 2 is close to 3).
Let's try: 23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> ?
Maybe 23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 19 is better? Then how to get 3?
Actually, 3 is somewhat central. 21 is central.
Let's look at 21 and 3. They connect the left/bottom groups to the center.
But 21 is close to 4. 3 is close to 2.

Let's try a strict perimeter approach and grab inner points when passing.
1.  **1**
2.  **16**
3.  **4**
4.  **21**
5.  **12**
6.  **5**
7.  **15**
8.  **23**
9.  **10**
10. **2**
11. **3**
12. **19**
13. **8**
14. **22**
15. **20**
16. **17**
17. **25**
18. **11**
19. **14**
20. **18**
21. **13**
22. **6**
23. **24**
24. **7**
25. **9**
Back to **1**.

Let's double check the bottom segment: **23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 19**.
Distance 3 to 19 is quite large.
Distance 2 to 19 is smaller.
Distance 10 to 19 is smaller.
Distance 3 to 8 is large.
Maybe the order is **23 -> 15 -> 5 -> 12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 19**.
Let's check the transition **21 -> 3**. That's a big jump across the middle.
What about **12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1...**?
Let's re-evaluate the middle.
4 is near 21. 21 is somewhat isolated in the middle left.
3 is near 2.
7 is near 9 and 24.

Let's try a path that snakes through:
**1 -> 16 -> 4 -> 21 -> 12 -> 5 -> 15 -> 23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 19 -> 8 -> 22 -> 20 -> 17 -> 25 -> 11 -> 14 -> 18 -> 13 -> 6 -> 24 -> 7 -> 9 -> 1**

Let's critique the **3 -> 19** link vs **2 -> 19** vs **10 -> 19**.
19 is at the very bottom. 10, 2, 3 are a vertical stack.
Closest to 19 is likely 2 or 10.
Closest to 8 (next on right) is 19.
So the sequence likely flows ... -> [stack 10,2,3] -> 19 -> 8 -> ...
The stack [10, 2, 3] needs to connect to the left (23).
Closest to 23 is 10.
So a good flow is **23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...** but 3 is now "stuck" at the top of the stack, far from 19.
Is 3 close to anything else? It's vaguely near 21 or 7, but those are far.
Wait, look at 3 and 21. They are "sort of" close.
And 7 is near 3.
Maybe the path cuts through the middle?
Let's look at **7 -> 3**. It's a bit of a stretch but plausible if we are spiraling.
However, usually these TSP plots are "single loops" without crossing.
Let's look at the gap between 3 and 19 again.
Maybe the order is **3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 19**. That works well geometrically.
So, we need to get *to* 3.
From where? Maybe from 21? Distance 21 -> 3 is medium.
From 7? Distance 7 -> 3 is medium.
From 8? No.

Let's reconsider the whole left side.
**1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 24 -> 6 -> 13 -> 18 -> 14 -> 11 -> 25 -> 17 -> 20 -> 22 -> 8 -> 19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3**.
Now we are at 3. We need to go left.
The points left are 23, 15, 5, 12, 21, 4, 16.
Closest to 3 is 21? Or maybe we should have gone 19 -> 2 -> 10 -> 23?
If we go **19 -> 2 -> 10 -> 23**, we leave 3 stranded.
So 3 must be integrated.
How about **19 -> 8 -> ...** is going right.
Coming from right: **...8 -> 19**.
Then **19 -> 2**.
Then **2 -> 3**.
Then **3 -> 10**? No, 3 is above 2. 10 is below 2.
Geometry: 3 (top), 2 (mid), 10 (bot).
So **3-2-10** or **10-2-3**.
If we do **19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3**, we end at 3.
From 3, where do we go?
To **21**? It's a bit of a jump, but 21 is isolated.
From **21**, we go to **4**, then **12**, then **5**, **15**, **23**.
From **23**, we have to close the loop back to... wait, 23 is far from 1.
The loop start/end logic is tricky here.

Let's look at the neighbors of 23.
23 is near 15 and 10.
So the path must be ...15 -> 23 -> 10... (or vice versa).
This implies the sequence for the bottom-left cluster is likely:
**...5 -> 15 -> 23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 21 -> 4 -> 12...**
Wait, 4 and 12 are near the left edge.
Let's trace:
15 -> 23 (good)
23 -> 10 (good)
10 -> 2 (good)
2 -> 3 (good)
3 -> 21 (shortest jump from that cluster inward)
21 -> 4 (good)
4 -> 16 (good)
16 -> 1 (good)
1 -> 9 (good)
...right side loop...
...8 -> 19.
Now, how to connect 19 to the start of that left chain?
We ended the right chain at 19.
We started the left chain at 5.
Distance 19 -> 5 is huge.
So the connection point must be different.
The connection is likely **19 -> 10** or **19 -> 2**.
If we do **...8 -> 19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3**, we are at 3.
Then **3 -> 21**?
Then **21 -> 4 -> 12 -> 5 -> 15 -> 23**?
Then **23 -> 16**? No, 23 is bottom left, 16 is top left.
This leaves a huge gap.

Let's try the other way around on the left.
Coming from top: **1 -> 16**.
Then **16 -> 21**? Or **16 -> 4**?
**16 -> 4** is very close.
**4 -> 21**.
**21 -> 12**. (A bit back-tracky).
**4 -> 12** is better.
Then **12 -> 5**.
**5 -> 15**.
**15 -> 23**.
**23 -> 10**.
**10 -> 2**.
**2 -> 3**.
**3 -> ?**
We need to get to 19. But 19 is below 3.
It would be **10 -> 19** or **2 -> 19**.
Let's rearrange the cluster {10, 2, 3, 23}.
Path: **23 -> 10 -> 19**. Then **19 -> 2**? No, backtracking.
Path: **23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 19**. (2 to 19 is a jump, skipping 3).
Where does 3 fit?
Maybe **23 -> 15 -> 5 -> 12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 19**?
Let's check jumps.
21 -> 3: Distance is ~3-4 units.
3 -> 2: Close.
2 -> 10: Close.
10 -> 19: Close.
19 -> 8: Close.
This looks very promising.
Let's check the start of that sequence.
**1 -> 16 -> 4**.
**4 -> 21**? Or **4 -> 12**?
If **4 -> 21**, then **21 -> 3** works well. But we leave 12, 5, 15, 23 stranded.
So it must be **4 -> 12 -> 5 -> 15 -> 23**.
From 23, how do we get to 10? **23 -> 10** is close.
From 10, we go **10 -> 2 -> 3**.
From 3, we are "stuck" inside. The nearest unvisited points are 21 and 7.
If we go **3 -> 21**, then **21 -> 4**... but we already visited 4.
Ah, I see. 21 needs to be visited *between* 4 and 3?
Or maybe **4 -> 21 -> 12**? No, 21 is inside 4 and 12.
Let's look at 21's position. It is between 4 and 7 essentially, horizontally.
Maybe **16 -> 4 -> 21 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 23 -> 15 -> 5 -> 12**?
Then **12 -> 1**? No, 12 is far from 1.
We need to close the loop at 1. The neighbors of 1 are 16 and 9.
So the path must ends at 16 or 9.
Let's assume path ends at 16.
So **... -> 16 -> 1**.
This implies we come up the left side.
So the previous point to 16 is likely 4 or 21.
If it's 4: **... -> 12 -> 21 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1**.
Is 12 -> 21 close? No.
Is 12 -> 4 close? Yes.
Is 4 -> 21 close? Yes.
Is 21 -> 16 close? Medium.
Is 4 -> 16 close? Yes.
So maybe **...12 -> 21 -> 4 -> 16** is awkward.
Maybe **...12 -> 5 -> 15 -> 23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 21 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1**?
Let's check the jump **3 -> 21**. It's reasonable.
Let's check **12 -> 5**. Reasonable.
Where does the path enter 12? From 23? No.
So we need a path that sweeps the bottom then goes up the left.
Let's try clockwise:
**1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 24 -> 6 -> 13 -> 18 -> 14 -> 11 -> 25 -> 17 -> 20 -> 22 -> 8 -> 19**.
From **19**:
Option A: **19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3**. From 3, jump to **21**. From 21, go to **4**. From 4, go to **12**. From 12, go to **5**. From 5 to **15**. From 15 to **23**.
Now we are at 23. We need to get back to **16** then **1**.
Distance 23 -> 16 is HUGE.
So this is a dead end. We can't end at 23.
We must weave 23 earlier.

Let's look at the bottom left corner again.
**...19 -> 8** (coming from right).
Actually **19** connects well to **10**.
And **23** connects well to **10** or **15**.
We need to go up the left side to reach 16/1.
So the sequence must be ascending on the left: **... -> 23 -> 15 -> 5 -> 12 -> ...**
How do we get to 23?
From **10**.
So **...19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 23**?
Distance 3 -> 10 is fine.
Distance 10 -> 23 is fine.
Distance 19 -> 2 is fine.
But we skipped 21 and 4.
After 12, we go **12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16**?
Distance 12 -> 4 is good.
Distance 4 -> 21 is good.
Distance 21 -> 16 is okay.
Distance 16 -> 1 is good.

Let's trace this full path hypothesis:
**1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16**.
Check the transitions:
1-9: Good.
9-7: Good.
7-24: Good.
24-6: Good.
6-13: Good.
13-18: Good.
18-14: Good.
14-11: Good.
11-25: Good.
25-17: Good.
17-20: Good.
20-22: Good.
22-8: Good.
8-19: Good.
19-2: Good (neighboring points).
2-3: Good (very close).
3-10: **Problem**. 3 is above 2. 10 is below 2. So 19->2->3 is moving UP. Then 3->10 is jumping DOWN over 2. This is a "crossing" potentially.
Better order for that cluster: **19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3**.
Then from 3, jump to where?
We need to get to **23**.
Distance 3 -> 23 is big.
Distance 10 -> 23 is small.
So we want to leave the cluster at 10?
Then the order must be **... -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 23**.
How do we enter 3?
From 19? **19 -> 3** is a bit of a stretch but maybe okay? No, 19-2 is shorter.
What if we come from 8 -> 22 -> 20 -> 17 -> 25... wait.
Maybe the "inner" points 21, 3, 7 need to be handled differently.
Let's look at **7**.
The sequence 9 -> 7 -> 24 is good.
What about 9 -> 24 -> 6 -> 13 -> 18 -> 14 -> 11 -> 25 -> 17 -> 20 -> 22 -> 8 -> 19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7... loop back?
No.

Let's reconsider the cluster around **19, 10, 2, 3**.
19 is bottom. 10 is left-ish. 2 is center. 3 is top.
Neighbors of 19: 8, 10, 2.
Neighbors of 23: 15, 10.
So the link **10-23** is strong.
The link **15-23** is strong.
So the chain is likely **...15-23-10...**
From 10, we have 2, 3, 19.
If we go **23-10-19-8**, we isolate 2 and 3.
So we must pick up 2 and 3.
**23-10-2-3-19-8**?
3 to 19 is a jump.
**23-10-19-2-3**?
2 to 3 is good.
3 to... where?
We need to go right towards 8? 3 to 8 is far.
So we probably are moving Left to Right or Right to Left.
If moving Right to Left (CCW):
**...8 -> 19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3...**
From 3 we need to go to 23? No, 3-23 is far.
Maybe **8 -> 19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 23**?
19 to 2 is good.
2 to 3 is good.
3 to 10 is a backtrack down.
10 to 23 is good.
This seems the most logical physical path to cover that group without crossing lines.
Path: **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 23**.
Let's verify the next steps.
**23 -> 15**.
**15 -> 5**.
**5 -> 12**.
**12 -> 4**.
**4 -> 21**. (Move inward).
**21 -> 16**. (Move up/out).
**16 -> 1**.
**1 -> 9**.
**9 -> 7**. (Inward).
**7 -> 24**.
**24 -> 6**.
**6 -> 13**.
**13 -> 18**.
**18 -> 14**.
**14 -> 11**.
**11 -> 25**.
**25 -> 17**.
**17 -> 20**.
**20 -> 22**.
**22 -> 8**.
**8 -> 19**.
This closes the loop perfectly!

Let's double check the segments that seemed slightly questionable.
1.  **3 -> 10**: 3 is above 2, 10 is below 2. Does the line 3->10 cross the line 19->2?
    *   19 is bottom right of 2.
    *   2 is center.
    *   3 is above 2.
    *   10 is bottom left of 2.
    *   Path: 19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10.
    *   Line 19->2 goes up-left. Line 2->3 goes up-left. Line 3->10 goes down-left.
    *   This creates a shape like an inverted 'V' or a hook. It does not cross itself. It goes up the spine and down the left side. This is valid.

2.  **4 -> 21 -> 16**:
    *   4 is left. 21 is right of 4. 16 is above 4.
    *   4 -> 21 goes right/down slightly.
    *   21 -> 16 goes up-left.
    *   This is a "V" shape.
    *   Does it cross 12->4? 12 is below 4. 12->4 goes up. 4->21 goes right. No crossing.
    *   Does it cross 16->1? 16->1 goes up-right. No crossing.
    *   Is there a better way?
        *   **4 -> 16 -> 21**? Then 21 to 1 is far.
        *   **21 -> 4 -> 16**? Requires coming from somewhere into 21. From 12? 12->21 is far.
        *   **12 -> 21 -> 4**? 12->21 crosses the 4-12 line? No, 21 is to the right. 12->21 is diagonal up-right. 21->4 is left. 4->16 is up. This works too.
        *   Let's compare distances.
        *   Path A: 12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16. (Edges: 12-4 short, 4-21 medium, 21-16 medium).
        *   Path B: 12 -> 21 -> 4 -> 16. (Edges: 12-21 long, 21-4 medium, 4-16 short).
        *   Path A seems shorter because 12 is directly below 4.

3.  **9 -> 7 -> 24**:
    *   9 is top-left of the cluster.
    *   7 is below-right of 9.
    *   24 is right of 7.
    *   This seems natural.

4.  **13 -> 18 vs 13 -> 6**:
    *   18 is top right corner.
    *   13 is below 18.
    *   6 is left of 13.
    *   Sequence: ...6 -> 13 -> 18 -> 14...
    *   6 is close to 24.
    *   24 -> 6 -> 13 -> 18 -> 14. This zig-zags up and then down the outside. Looks correct.

Let's refine the list order based on "Start at 1".

**Sequence:**
1.  **1**
2.  **9**
3.  **7**
4.  **24**
5.  **6**
6.  **13**
7.  **18**
8.  **14**
9.  **11**
10. **25**
11. **17**
12. **20**
13. **22**
14. **8**
15. **19**
16. **2**
17. **3**
18. **10**
19. **23**
20. **15**
21. **5**
22. **12**
23. **4**
24. **21**
25. **16**
(And back to 1).

Let me re-verify the "21 to 16" vs "21 to 1" jump.
21 is located centrally between 4, 16, 7, 3.
If we end with ...4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1.
Distance 21 to 16 is roughly the same as 4 to 16.
Distance 16 to 1 is medium.
Is there an alternative?
...4 -> 16 -> 21 -> 1?
21 is far from 1.
...4 -> 16 -> 1... then where does 21 go?
Maybe **9 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1**?
Distance 9 -> 21 is medium. 21 -> 16 is medium.
But then we break the 4-16 chain.
If we go **12 -> 4 -> 16 -> 21 -> 7...**?
7 connects to 9 and 24.
If we do **...16 -> 1 -> 9 -> 21 -> 7 -> 24...**?
1 -> 9 is good.
9 -> 21 is a bit inward.
21 -> 7 is close.
7 -> 24 is close.
This puts 21 on the right side loop instead of the left.
Let's visually check position of 21.
21 is at (x,y) approx (40, 55).
4 is at (30, 52).
16 is at (35, 70).
3 is at (50, 20).
7 is at (55, 65).
21 is definitely closer to 4 and 16 than to 7.
It's left-of-center.
So grouping 21 with 4 and 16 is correct.
The sequence **12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1** seems optimal.
Or **12 -> 5 -> 15 -> 23 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 21 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1**?
Let's check 3 -> 21 again.
3 is at ~ (50, 20).
21 is at ~ (40, 55).
Distance is sqrt(10^2 + 35^2) approx 36.
Distance 4 -> 21 is approx 10.
Distance 3 -> 21 is a LONG jump.
Is there a way to avoid the 3 -> 21 jump?
My previous path was **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 23**. This avoids 3 -> 21.
It connects 10 to 23.
Then **23 -> 15 -> 5 -> 12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1**.
This seems solid.
Let's re-verify **3 -> 10** distance.
3 is at (50, 20).
2 is at (50, 15).
10 is at (48, 10).
3->10 is distance ~10. Very close.
So **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10** is efficient.
Wait, 19 is at (65, 5).
19 -> 2 is distance ~20.
19 -> 10 is distance ~18.
19 -> 3 is distance ~25.
The order **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10** works.
Or **19 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3**?
19 -> 10 (~18).
10 -> 2 (~5).
2 -> 3 (~5).
3 -> 23? No.
If we end at 3, we have to jump to 21 or 23. Both are far.
If we end at 10, we can jump to 23 (distance ~15).
So ending the cluster at 10 is superior.
So the cluster traversal must be **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10** (or similar ending in 10).
How about **19 -> 8 -> 22...** going the other way?
No, we established the CCW flow is good.
So **19 -> 2** is the entry.
Is **19 -> 3** better? No.
Is **19 -> 8** (backwards)? No.
What about **19 -> 10**?
If **19 -> 10**, then **10 -> 2 -> 3**. Stuck at 3.
Unless **3 -> 21** is taken. But we deemed that long.
Wait, let's look at **7**.
Is 7 close to 3?
7 is at (55, 65). 3 is at (50, 20). Very far.
So 3 is really isolated from the top.
It must connect to the bottom/left.
Its neighbors are 2, 10, 19, 21.
21 is far.
So 3 connects to 2.
2 connects to 10 and 19.
So 3 is a dead end of a spur, or part of a loop passing through 2.
Since it's a loop, 3 must have TWO connections.
One is definitely 2.
What is the other?
It's either 21, 10, 19, or maybe a long jump to 8?
3 to 8 is (50,20) to (75, 18). Distance 25.
3 to 21 is (50,20) to (40, 55). Distance 36.
3 to 10 is (50,20) to (48, 10). Distance 10.
3 to 19 is (50,20) to (65, 5). Distance 20.
So the connections for 3 are most likely **2 and 10**.
If connections are 2 and 10, the path segment is **2 - 3 - 10**.
This fits perfectly into **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 23**.
Let's check 19 -> 2. Distance ~18.
Let's check 19 -> 10. Distance ~17.
Is there a cross?
19(65,5) -> 2(50,15).
3(50,20) -> 10(48,10).
Segments (19,2) and (3,10).
19 is right-down. 2 is left-up.
3 is up. 10 is down.
These lines do not intersect. They are roughly parallel zig-zags.
Sequence **19 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 23** is geometrically sound.

Final check of the full path:
**1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16**.
16 -> 1 closes the loop.

Let's verify point 20-22-8-19.
17 -> 20.
20 -> 22.
22 -> 8.
8 -> 19.
This follows the bottom curve smoothly.

Let's verify 5-12-4-21-16.
15 -> 5 (leftmost bottom).
5 -> 12 (up).
12 -> 4 (up).
4 -> 21 (right).
21 -> 16 (up-left).
16 -> 1 (up-right).
This seems valid.
Is **4 -> 16 -> 21** better?
4 (30, 52).
16 (35, 70).
21 (40, 55).
1 (50, 90).
9 (48, 75).
Path A: 4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1.
Dist(4,21) ~ 10.
Dist(21,16) ~ 15.
Dist(16,1) ~ 25.
Total ~ 50.
Path B: 4 -> 16 -> 21 -> 1?? No, 21 -> 1 is far.
Path C: 4 -> 16 -> 9 -> 21?? No.
Path D: 4 -> 21 -> 9 -> 1??
Dist(4,21) ~ 10.
Dist(21,9) ~ 20.
Dist(9,1) ~ 15.
This skips 16. Where is 16?
If 16 is skipped, we have to insert it.
...4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 9 -> 1?
16 to 9 is somewhat lateral. 16 is (35,70), 9 is (48,75). Distance ~13.
16 -> 1 is ~25.
9 -> 1 is ~15.
So 16->9->1 is better than 16->1->9.
Let's check 21 -> 16 vs 21 -> 9.
21(40,55) -> 16(35,70) is ~15.
21(40,55) -> 9(48,75) is ~20.
So 21 -> 16 is better.
So **4 -> 21 -> 16** is the cluster sequence.
From 16, where to?
To 9? Or to 1?
16 is left. 1 is top center. 9 is below 1.
If we go **16 -> 9**, then **9 -> 1**.
Then **1 -> 18**? No, that jumps over 7, 24...
If we go **16 -> 9**, we are inside the loop. 9 connects to 7.
Then **7 -> 24...** and around.
Then we end at 18. **18 -> 1** closes the loop.
Let's check this variant.
Loop start: **1**.
**1 -> 16**.
**16 -> 21**.
**21 -> 4**.
**4 -> 12**.
**12 -> 5**.
**5 -> 15**.
**15 -> 23**.
**23 -> 10**.
**10 -> 3**. (Note order swap: 10 is bottom, 3 is top).
**3 -> 2**.
**2 -> 19**.
**19 -> 8**.
**8 -> 22**.
**22 -> 20**.
**20 -> 17**.
**17 -> 25**.
**25 -> 11**.
**11 -> 14**.
**14 -> 18**.
**18 -> 13**.
**13 -> 6**.
**6 -> 24**.
**24 -> 7**.
**7 -> 9**.
**9 -> 1**.
Let's evaluate the closure **9 -> 1**. Good.
Let's evaluate the start **1 -> 16**.
1(50,90) to 16(35,70). Distance ~25.
Compare to **1 -> 9**. Distance ~15.
1 -> 16 is longer.
Let's evaluate the **21** position again.
In the previous path: **...4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1**.
In this path: **1 -> 16 -> 21 -> 4...**
Basically the same edges, just reversed direction.
The closure **16 -> 1** vs **9 -> 1**.
9 is closer to 1.
So ending at 9 is better than ending at 16?
If we end at 9, we must approach from 7.
Sequence: **... -> 7 -> 9 -> 1**.
Then from 1 we go to **16**.
This is the **counter-clockwise** version of my first valid path.
My first path was Clockwise: 1->9...->16->1.
Edges are: 1-9 (15), 16-1 (25).
CCW path: 1->16 (25), 9-1 (15).
It's the same loop distance, just direction.
So the list I generated first (Clockwise) is perfectly fine.

Let's double check **21 -> 16**.
Is **21 -> 9** better?
If **4 -> 21 -> 9 -> 7...** we skip 16.
16 is the outlier on the top left.
It must connect to 1 and something else.
Neighbors of 16: 1, 4, 21.
Dist(16,1) ~ 25.
Dist(16,4) ~ 18.
Dist(16,21) ~ 15.
So 16 connects best to 21 and 4.
This creates a path segment **1 -> 16 -> 4** ? No, that skips 21.
**1 -> 16 -> 21 -> 4** ?
16->21 (15). 21->4 (10). Total 25.
16->4 (18). 4->21 (10). Total 28.
So 16-21-4 is slightly better than 16-4-21.
Wait, let's look at the map.
16 is high left. 4 is low left. 21 is right of 4.
Visual triangle 16-4-21.
16 is top. 4 is bottom-left. 21 is bottom-right.
Coming from 1 (top right of 16).
Path **1 -> 16**.
Then to **21** or **4**?
Visually 21 is "inside". 4 is "outside wall".
If we follow the hull: **1 -> 16 -> 4 -> 12...**
Then where does 21 fit?
**4 -> 21 -> ...** where?
To **3**? We said 21->3 is far.
To **12**? Backtracking.
To **7**? Far.
So 21 is the problem.
If 21 is connected to 16 and 4, it's a detour.
**...4 -> 21 -> 16...** or **...16 -> 21 -> 4...**.
In my Clockwise path: **...12 -> 4 -> 21 -> 16 -> 1**.
Edge 4 -> 21 (10).
Edge 21 -> 16 (15).
Edge 16 -> 1 (25).
Total: 50.
Alternative: **...12 -> 21 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1**.
Edge 12 -> 21 (Long, cross 4). Bad.
Alternative: **...12 -> 4 -> 16 -> 21 -> 1?**
Edge 4 -> 16 (18).
Edge 16 -> 21 (15).
Edge 21 -> 1 (High, ~35).
Bad.
Alternative: **...12 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1**. Where is 21?
Maybe 21 connects to 9?
**...16 -> 1 -> 9 -> 21 -> 7...**
Edge 9 -> 21 (~20).
Edge 21 -> 7 (~15).
Edge 7 -> 24 (~15).
This detour **9 -> 21 -> 7** looks very plausible!
Let's check the map again.
9 is (48, 75).
7 is (55, 65).
21 is (40, 55).
Triangle 9-7-21.
9 is top. 7 is right. 21 is left.
Path 9 -> 7 (straight). 21 is left hanging.
Path 9 -> 21 -> 7.
9->21 (~20). 21->7 (~15). Total 35.
Direct 9->7 (~12).
Detour cost = 23.
Previous connection for 21 was **4 -> 21 -> 16**.
4->16 direct is 18.
4->21 (10) + 21->16 (15) = 25.
Detour cost = 7.
The detour at the left (4-21-16) is MUCH cheaper than at the top (9-21-7).
So 21 belongs with 4 and 16.

Final check of the list.
1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16.

Are there any swaps?
**13, 18** vs **18, 13**?
Coming from 6. 6 is low-left of the cluster.
18 is high-right. 13 is mid.
6 -> 13 -> 18 -> 14. Smooth.
6 -> 18 -> 13 -> 14. 6->18 is crossing 13. Bad.
So **6, 13, 18, 14** is correct.

**24, 6** vs **6, 24**?
Coming from 7.
7 is high-left.
24 is left. 6 is right.
7 -> 24 -> 6 -> 13.
7 -> 6 (cross 24). Bad.
So **7, 24, 6** is correct.

**17, 20, 22, 8**.
25 is high.
17 is below 25.
20 is below 17.
22 is left of 20? No, 22 is left of 8.
Let's look closely at 20, 22, 8.
20 is rightmost bottom.
22 is left of 20.
8 is left of 22.
Path **17 -> 20 -> 22 -> 8 -> 19**.
This is a straight line sweep right-to-left. Correct.

**19, 2, 3, 10**.
Verified as valid zigzag.

**15, 5, 12, 4**.
23 to 15 (up-left).
15 to 5 (left).
5 to 12 (up-right).
12 to 4 (up).
Correct.

The sequence seems robust.

One final check on point **19**.
Is it better to go **8 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 19 -> 23**?
8 -> 2 is a jump. 8 is (75, 18). 2 is (50, 15). Distance 25.
8 -> 19 is (75, 18) to (65, 5). Distance 16.
19 -> 2 is (65, 5) to (50, 15). Distance 18.
So 8->19->2 is better than 8->2.
So 19 must be visited before the cluster 2/3/10.

Final List:
1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16

1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16

Example format required: 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6
My list: 1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16

Wait, is **3 -> 10** valid?
3 (50, 20). 10 (48, 10).
Yes, they are vertical neighbors essentially.
Is **10 -> 23** valid?
10 (48, 10). 23 (25, 5).
There is a gap, but it's the bridge between the central cluster and the left corner.
Are there points in between?
15 is at (15, 20).
19 is at (65, 5).
No points impede 10 -> 23.
Is 2 -> 23 better? 2(50,15) -> 23(25,5). Longer than 10->23.
Is 19 -> 23 better? 19(65,5) -> 23(25,5). Crosses 10. Bad.
So 10 -> 23 is the bridge.

Looks good.

One small jitter possibility: **14, 11, 25**.
14 is (90, 60).
11 is (95, 50).
25 is (95, 40).
14 -> 11 -> 25. Straight line down the right edge. Correct.
If 11 was inside... but it's outside.

**13, 6, 24** vs **13, 24, 6**?
13 (80, 70).
6 (75, 68).
24 (70, 65).
Sequence 13 -> 6 -> 24.
Distances are small. Correct order.

The answer is solid.

1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 2, 3, 10, 23, 15, 5, 12, 4, 21, 16
