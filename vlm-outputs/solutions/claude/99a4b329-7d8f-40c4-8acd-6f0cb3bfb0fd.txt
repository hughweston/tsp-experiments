I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (720, 210)
2: (215, 295)
3: (595, 150)
4: (390, 225)
5: (500, 270)
6: (250, 365)
7: (60, 120)
8: (95, 245)
9: (295, 295)
10: (560, 115)
11: (725, 45)
12: (220, 340)
13: (500, 120)
14: (95, 165)
15: (455, 365)
16: (120, 330)
17: (640, 175)
18: (740, 155)
19: (500, 335)
20: (50, 375)
21: (570, 175)
22: (365, 235)
23: (410, 345)
24: (695, 80)
25: (735, 265)
26: (690, 300)
27: (295, 255)
28: (640, 85)
29: (55, 280)
30: (160, 375)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the spatial layout and using a nearest-neighbor approach combined with visual optimization.

Starting from the leftmost points and working through clusters:

Looking at the layout, I can identify a rough path:
- Bottom left cluster: 20, 30, 16, 29, 8, 14, 7
- Middle left: 2, 12, 6, 27, 9
- Center: 22, 4
- Lower middle-right: 23, 15, 19, 5
- Upper middle-right: 13, 10, 21, 3
- Right side top: 28, 24, 11, 18, 1
- Right side bottom: 25, 26, 17

Let me trace a logical tour minimizing backtracking:

7 → 14 → 8 → 29 → 20 → 30 → 16 → 12 → 6 → 2 → 9 → 27 → 22 → 4 → 5 → 23 → 15 → 19 → 26 → 25 → 1 → 18 → 17 → 21 → 3 → 10 → 13 → 28 → 24 → 11

Let me verify and optimize this path by checking for crossing lines and shorter connections:

Refined tour:
20 → 30 → 16 → 12 → 6 → 9 → 2 → 27 → 22 → 4 → 5 → 23 → 15 → 19 → 26 → 25 → 1 → 18 → 17 → 21 → 3 → 10 → 13 → 28 → 24 → 11 → 7 → 14 → 8 → 29

Wait, let me reconsider the upper portion: 11 → 24 → 28 → 10 → 13 → 21 → 3 → 17 → 18 → 1 → 25 → 26

Final optimized tour:

20, 30, 16, 12, 6, 9, 2, 27, 22, 4, 13, 10, 28, 24, 11, 18, 1, 25, 26, 17, 21, 3, 5, 19, 15, 23, 14, 7, 8, 29

Let me re-examine: 7, 14, 8, 29, 20, 30, 16, 12, 6, 9, 2, 27, 22, 4, 23, 15, 19, 5, 26, 25, 1, 18, 17, 21, 3, 10, 13, 28, 24, 11

**Answer:**
7, 14, 8, 29, 20, 30,
