I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (400, 47)
9: (378, 103)
16: (285, 133)
7: (410, 160)
18: (640, 100)
6: (560, 140)
13: (610, 145)
24: (530, 175)
14: (680, 180)
11: (710, 175)
4: (215, 230)
21: (320, 245)
25: (695, 235)
12: (245, 295)
5: (60, 350)
15: (130, 350)
3: (380, 340)
2: (395, 375)
8: (580, 345)
17: (700, 340)
10: (350, 400)
19: (530, 405)
22: (645, 385)
20: (725, 380)
23: (115, 420)

Now I'll find a short tour by connecting nearby points. Let me trace a logical path:

Starting from point 1 at the top, I'll work around the perimeter and through clusters:

1 → 9 (nearby below)
9 → 16 (left)
16 → 4 (down-left)
4 → 12 (below)
12 → 15 (down-left)
15 → 5 (left)
5 → 23 (down)
23 → 10 (right)
10 → 2 (up-right)
2 → 3 (up)
3 → 21 (up-left)
21 → 7 (up-right)
7 → 24 (right)
24 → 6 (up-right)
6 → 13 (right)
13 → 18 (up-right)
18 → 14 (down)
14 → 11 (right)
11 → 25 (down)
25 → 17 (down)
17 → 20 (down-right)
20 → 22 (left)
22 → 8 (left)
8 → 19 (down-left)
19 → back to start

Let me reconsider to optimize the route, especially the middle section:

1 → 9 → 7 → 16 → 21 → 4 → 12 → 15 → 5 → 23 → 10 → 2 → 3 → 19 → 8 → 22 → 20 → 17 → 25 → 11 → 14 → 13 → 18 → 6 → 24 → 1

Let me try another approach focusing on a cleaner loop:

1 → 9 → 7 → 24 → 6 → 13 → 18 → 14 → 11 → 25 → 17 → 20 → 22 → 8 → 19 → 10 → 2 → 3 → 21 → 12 → 4 → 16 → 15 → 5 → 23 → 1

This doesn't close well. Let me refine:

1, 9, 16, 4, 21, 12, 15, 5, 23, 10, 2, 3, 19, 8, 22, 20, 17, 25, 11, 14, 13, 18, 6, 24, 7

**1, 9, 7, 24, 6, 13, 18, 14, 11, 25, 17, 20, 22, 8, 19, 10, 2, 3, 21, 16, 4, 12, 15, 5, 23**
