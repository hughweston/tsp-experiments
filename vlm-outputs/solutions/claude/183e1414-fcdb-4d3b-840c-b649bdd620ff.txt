I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (680, 390)
- Point 2: (65, 65)
- Point 3: (330, 295)
- Point 4: (295, 210)
- Point 5: (30, 250)
- Point 6: (80, 295)
- Point 7: (200, 345)
- Point 8: (680, 320)
- Point 9: (645, 215)
- Point 10: (760, 460)

Now I need to find a tour that minimizes total distance. Let me analyze the positions:
- Points 2, 5, 6, 7 are on the left side
- Points 3, 4 are in the middle
- Points 1, 8, 9, 10 are on the right side

A good strategy is to create a tour that doesn't have crossing paths.

Looking at the layout, I'll try to trace a logical path:

Starting from the left side and moving systematically:
- Point 2 (top left)
- Point 5 (left middle)
- Point 6 (slightly right of 5)
- Point 7 (below and right of 6)
- Point 3 (middle)
- Point 4 (above 3)
- Point 9 (right side, upper)
- Point 8 (right side, middle)
- Point 1 (right side, lower)
- Point 10 (bottom right)
- Back to 2

Let me verify this makes a reasonable loop: 2 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 3 → 4 → 9 → 8 → 1 → 10 → 2

This creates a path that goes down the left side, across the middle, up to the right side, then down and back.

Let me check an alternative: 2 → 4 → 3 → 7 → 6 → 5 → (back would be long)

Actually, a better tour might be:
2 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 3 → 4 → 9 → 8 → 1 → 10 → back to 2

The return from 10 to 2 is long, but unavoidable given the layout.

Let me also consider: 2 → 4 → 9 → 8 → 1 → 10 → (need to get to left side) → 3 → 7 → 6 → 5 → 2

This might work: 5 → 2 → 4 → 9 → 8 → 1 → 10 → 3 → 7 → 6 → 5

Comparing paths, a good solution appears to be:

**2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 9, 8, 1, 10**
