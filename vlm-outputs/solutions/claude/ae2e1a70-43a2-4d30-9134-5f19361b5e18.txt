I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (550, 45)
- Point 2: (175, 45)
- Point 3: (480, 220)
- Point 4: (620, 95)
- Point 5: (410, 430)
- Point 6: (250, 135)
- Point 7: (45, 270)
- Point 8: (430, 370)
- Point 9: (560, 220)
- Point 10: (270, 70)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all points. Let me analyze the positions and find a logical path that minimizes backtracking.

Looking at the layout:
- Top right area: 1, 4
- Top left area: 2, 10
- Middle left: 6, 7
- Middle right: 3, 9
- Bottom middle: 5, 8

Let me try to find a tour that moves efficiently through these clusters:

Starting from point 7 (leftmost), I can trace a path:
- 7 (far left) → 6 (up and right) → 2 (up) → 10 (nearby) → 1 (right) → 4 (down-right) → 9 (down) → 3 (left slightly) → 8 (down) → 5 (down-left) → back to 7

Let me calculate this roughly and try alternatives:

Tour: 7 → 6 → 2 → 10 → 1 → 4 → 9 → 3 → 8 → 5 → 7

Another option following the outer boundary:
2 → 10 → 6 → 7 → 5 → 8 → 3 → 9 → 4 → 1 → 2

Let me trace a more efficient path considering nearest neighbors and avoiding crossings:

7 → 6 → 10 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 9 → 3 → 8 → 5 → 7

Or: 2 → 10 → 6 → 7 → 5 → 8 → 3 → 9 → 4 → 1 → 2

Checking for a clean loop without crossings:
1 → 4 → 9 → 3 → 8 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 10 → 2 → 1

This creates a roughly circular path that should be efficient.
