I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (640, 295)
2: (290, 285)
3: (645, 47)
4: (305, 130)
5: (670, 175)
6: (115, 390)
7: (700, 105)
8: (300, 335)
9: (635, 195)
10: (390, 145)
11: (455, 355)
12: (225, 305)
13: (385, 320)
14: (100, 210)
15: (95, 47)
16: (160, 365)
17: (570, 385)
18: (455, 70)
19: (595, 42)
20: (600, 320)
21: (755, 70)
22: (500, 120)
23: (520, 320)
24: (295, 320)
25: (100, 265)

Now I'll find a good tour by considering geographical clusters and nearest neighbor heuristics, then try to optimize.

Looking at the layout, I can identify clusters:
- Top right: 3, 19, 21, 7, 5
- Top middle: 18, 22, 10, 4
- Top left: 15
- Left side: 14, 25, 6, 16
- Middle: 2, 12, 24, 8, 13
- Right middle: 9, 1, 20, 23
- Bottom: 11, 17

Let me construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from 15 (top left), going clockwise:
15 → 14 → 25 → 6 → 16 → 12 → 24 → 8 → 2 → 4 → 10 → 18 → 19 → 3 → 21 → 7 → 5 → 9 → 22 → 1 → 20 → 23 → 17 → 11 → 13 → back to 15

Let me refine this by checking the path more carefully:

15 → 4 → 10 → 18 → 19 → 3 → 21 → 7 → 5 → 9 → 22 → 1 → 20 → 17 → 23 → 11 → 13 → 8 → 24 → 2 → 12 → 16 → 6 → 25 → 14 → 15

Reordering for a smoother path:

15 → 14 → 25 → 6 → 16 → 12 → 2 → 24 → 8 → 13 → 11 → 17 → 23 → 20 → 1 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 21 → 3 → 19 → 18 → 22 → 10 → 4 → 15

**Answer:**
15, 4, 10, 18, 19, 3, 21, 7, 5, 9, 22, 1, 20, 23, 17, 11, 13, 8, 24, 2, 12, 16, 6, 25, 14
