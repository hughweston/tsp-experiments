I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 30 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of all points from the image:

- Point 1: bottom left
- Point 7: top left area
- Point 27: top area, near 7
- Point 8: top center
- Point 19: top center-right
- Point 30: upper right area
- Point 21: right side, upper
- Point 20: right side
- Point 2: right side
- Point 5: right side
- Point 11: center-upper
- Point 4: center
- Point 22: center-right
- Point 15: left side
- Point 16: left side
- Point 24: left side
- Point 25: left-center
- Point 18: center
- Point 26: center
- Point 28: lower left
- Point 12: lower center
- Point 6: lower center
- Point 13: lower center
- Point 14: lower center-right
- Point 9: center-right
- Point 3: center-right
- Point 17: right side
- Point 23: right side
- Point 10: lower right
- Point 29: bottom right

Let me trace a logical tour by connecting nearby points:

Starting from point 1 (bottom left), I'll try to create a tour that minimizes backtracking:

1 → 28 → 24 → 16 → 15 → 25 → 7 → 27 → 8 → 19 → 30 → 11 → 4 → 22 → 21 → 20 → 2 → 5 → 17 → 23 → 3 → 9 → 14 → 10 → 29 → 13 → 6 → 12 → 26 → 18 → back to 1

Let me verify this makes a reasonable path by checking the geography:
- Bottom left: 1 → 28 → 24 → 16 → 15 (up the left side)
- 15 → 25 → 7 → 27 → 8 → 19 (across the top)
- 19 → 30 → 11 → 4 → 22 (descending center-right)
- 22 → 21 → 20 → 2 → 5 → 17 → 23 (right side down)
- 23 → 3 → 9 → 14 → 10 → 29 (lower right area)
- 29 → 13 → 6 → 12 → 26 → 18 → back to 1 (bottom center back to left)

This creates a roughly circular tour.

1, 28, 24, 16, 15, 25, 7, 27, 8, 19, 30, 11, 4, 22, 21, 20, 2, 5, 17, 23, 3, 9, 14, 10, 29, 13, 6, 12, 26, 18
