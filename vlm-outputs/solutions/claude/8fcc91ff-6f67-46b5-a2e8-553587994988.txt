I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (520, 410)
2: (620, 135)
3: (340, 65)
4: (540, 470)
5: (645, 325)
6: (50, 435)
7: (540, 375)
8: (270, 460)
9: (410, 270)
10: (80, 105)
11: (665, 365)
12: (160, 465)
13: (270, 110)
14: (70, 195)
15: (35, 160)
16: (150, 30)
17: (365, 365)
18: (570, 265)
19: (145, 135)
20: (175, 195)
21: (700, 295)
22: (190, 95)
23: (30, 25)
24: (450, 390)
25: (565, 395)
26: (700, 455)
27: (185, 50)
28: (500, 160)
29: (630, 400)
30: (260, 45)

Let me find a good tour by grouping nearby points and connecting them efficiently.

Starting from the top-left and working around:
- Top left cluster: 23, 16, 27, 30, 22, 10, 19, 15, 14, 20
- Top middle: 3, 13
- Top right: 2, 28
- Right side: 18, 5, 21, 11, 29, 26
- Bottom middle: 4, 25, 7, 24, 1
- Bottom left: 8, 12, 6
- Middle: 9, 17

Let me trace a logical tour:

Starting at 23 (top-left corner):
23 → 16 → 27 → 30 → 3 → 13 → 22 → 10 → 19 → 15 → 14 → 20 → 6 → 12 → 8 → 17 → 9 → 24 → 1 → 7 → 25 → 4 → 26 → 29 → 11 → 21 → 5 → 18 → 28 → 2 → back to 23

Let me refine this by checking the path more carefully:

23 → 16 → 27 → 22 → 30 → 3 → 13 → 19 → 10 → 15 → 14 → 20 → 6 → 12 → 8 → 17 → 24 → 1 → 4 → 26 → 29 → 25 → 7 → 11 → 21 → 5 → 18 → 28 → 2 → 9 → back to 23

After more careful analysis:

23, 16, 27, 22, 30, 3, 13, 19, 10, 15, 14, 20, 6, 12, 8, 17, 9, 24, 1, 7, 25, 4, 26, 29, 11, 21, 5, 18, 28, 2
