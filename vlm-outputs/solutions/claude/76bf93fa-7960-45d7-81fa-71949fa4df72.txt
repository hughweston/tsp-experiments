I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (400, 248)
- Point 2: (480, 352)
- Point 3: (640, 368)
- Point 4: (47, 52)
- Point 5: (175, 68)
- Point 6: (450, 152)
- Point 7: (200, 140)
- Point 8: (32, 132)
- Point 9: (320, 80)
- Point 10: (530, 45)
- Point 11: (345, 248)
- Point 12: (95, 480)
- Point 13: (640, 68)
- Point 14: (280, 400)
- Point 15: (190, 280)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and avoiding crossing paths.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left region: 4, 8, 5, 7
- Top middle/right: 9, 10, 13, 6
- Middle: 11, 1, 15
- Bottom: 12, 14, 2, 3

Let me try to construct a tour that moves efficiently through these regions:

Starting from point 4 (top left), I can go:
4 → 8 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 10 → 13 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 14 → 12 → 15 → 11 → back to 4

Let me check another route:
4 → 5 → 9 → 10 → 13 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 14 → 12 → 15 → 11 → 7 → 8 → 4

Or trying to make a smoother loop:
8 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 15 → 12 → 14 → 2 → 3 → 13 → 10 → 6 → 9 → 1 → 11 → 8

Let me reconsider by tracing a clean outer loop:
4 → 8 → 12 → 14 → 2 → 3 → 13 → 10 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 15 → 11 → 1 → 4

Refining further:
8 → 4 → 5 → 9 → 10 → 13 → 6 → 1 → 11 → 15 → 7 → 14 → 12 → 2 → 3 → 8

This doesn't seem optimal. Let me try:
4 → 5 → 9 → 10 → 13 → 3 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 14 → 12 → 8 → 7 → 15 → 11 → 4

Better attempt following a logical path:
12 → 8 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 10 → 13 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 11 → 15 → 14 → 12

Final answer:

**4, 8, 12, 14, 15, 7, 5, 9, 10, 13, 3, 2, 6, 1, 11**
