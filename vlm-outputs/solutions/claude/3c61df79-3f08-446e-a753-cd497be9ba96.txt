I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (85, 190)
2. (255, 220)
3. (215, 95)
4. (160, 195)
5. (580, 250)
6. (500, 175)
7. (310, 390)
8. (530, 200)
9. (540, 385)
10. (620, 255)
11. (720, 365)
12. (660, 80)
13. (345, 355)
14. (575, 395)
15. (565, 230)
16. (330, 175)
17. (285, 305)
18. (290, 435)
19. (230, 270)
20. (640, 55)
21. (185, 60)
22. (440, 285)
23. (680, 420)
24. (530, 360)
25. (310, 55)

Now I'll construct a tour by finding nearby points and creating a logical path that minimizes backtracking.

Starting from point 1 and moving through nearby points:
- 1 (85, 190) → 4 (160, 195) → 21 (185, 60) → 3 (215, 95) → 25 (310, 55) → 20 (640, 55) → 12 (660, 80) → 10 (620, 255) → 11 (720, 365) → 23 (680, 420) → 14 (575, 395) → 24 (530, 360) → 9 (540, 385) → 5 (580, 250) → 15 (565, 230) → 8 (530, 200) → 6 (500, 175) → 22 (440, 285) → 16 (330, 175) → 2 (255, 220) → 19 (230, 270) → 17 (285, 305) → 13 (345, 355) → 7 (310, 390) → 18 (290, 435) → back to 1

Let me verify and optimize this path by checking for crossing edges and potential improvements.

After analysis, a good tour appears to be:

1, 4, 21, 3, 25, 16, 2, 19, 17, 18, 7, 13, 22, 6, 8, 15, 5, 10, 12, 20, 11, 23, 14, 24, 9

**1, 4, 21, 3, 25, 16, 2, 19, 17, 18, 7, 13, 22, 6, 8, 15, 5, 10, 12, 20, 11, 23, 14, 24, 9**
