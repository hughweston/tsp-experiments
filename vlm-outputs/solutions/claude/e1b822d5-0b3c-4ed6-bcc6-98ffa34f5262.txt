I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (70, 320)
- Point 2: (55, 105)
- Point 3: (340, 430)
- Point 4: (175, 45)
- Point 5: (640, 95)
- Point 6: (310, 230)
- Point 7: (645, 165)
- Point 8: (85, 195)
- Point 9: (35, 355)
- Point 10: (425, 235)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all these points. Let me analyze the layout:
- Points 9, 1 are in the lower left
- Points 2, 8 are in the upper left
- Point 4 is at the top
- Points 5, 7 are on the right side
- Points 6, 10 are in the middle
- Point 3 is at the bottom middle

Let me try to find a tour that doesn't cross itself and follows a logical path:

Starting from point 9 (bottom left), I'll try to make a loop:
- 9 → 1 (nearby, both bottom left)
- 1 → 8 (up the left side)
- 8 → 2 (continue up left)
- 2 → 4 (to the top)
- 4 → 5 (across to top right)
- 5 → 7 (down slightly on right)
- 7 → 10 (toward middle)
- 10 → 6 (left in middle)
- 6 → 3 (down to bottom)
- 3 → 9 (back to start)

Let me check another possibility to avoid long crossings:
- 9 → 1 → 8 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 10 → 3 → 6 → 9

Or trying a more circular path:
- 4 → 2 → 8 → 1 → 9 → 3 → 10 → 7 → 5 → 6 → 4

Let me reconsider the middle section. Point 6 is between 3 and the upper points.

A good tour appears to be:
9 → 1 → 8 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 10 → 6 → 3 → 9

This creates a roughly circular path without major crossings.

**Answer:** 9, 1, 8, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 6, 3
