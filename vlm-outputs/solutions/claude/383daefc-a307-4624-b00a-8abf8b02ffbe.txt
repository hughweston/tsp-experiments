I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (220, 430)
- Point 2: (480, 150)
- Point 3: (115, 310)
- Point 4: (250, 440)
- Point 5: (680, 35)
- Point 6: (640, 330)
- Point 7: (580, 460)
- Point 8: (35, 215)
- Point 9: (430, 105)
- Point 10: (75, 295)
- Point 11: (730, 450)
- Point 12: (135, 340)
- Point 13: (195, 440)
- Point 14: (530, 250)
- Point 15: (65, 350)

Let me identify clusters and find a good route:
- Left cluster: 8, 10, 3, 15, 12
- Bottom middle: 13, 1, 4
- Upper right area: 9, 2, 5, 14
- Right side: 6, 11, 7

I'll try to find a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence.

Starting from point 8 (far left), I'll trace a logical path:
- 8 → 10 → 3 → 12 → 15 (left cluster)
- 15 → 13 → 1 → 4 (bottom left to middle)
- 4 → 7 → 11 (bottom right)
- 11 → 6 → 14 → 2 → 9 → 5 (right side going up)
- 5 → 9 → 2 → 14 → 6 → 11 → 7 (need to reconsider)

Let me reconsider a better path:
- Start at 8, go to nearby 10 → 3 → 12 → 15
- Then 15 → 13 → 1 → 4 (bottom area)
- 4 → 7 → 11 → 6 (right bottom to middle right)
- 6 → 14 → 2 → 9 → 5 (going up on right)
- 5 → back to 8 (long jump, but necessary)

Checking another route to minimize the long jumps:
8 → 10 → 3 → 12 → 15 → 13 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 11 → 6 → 14 → 2 → 9 → 5 → 8

Let me try: 5 → 9 → 2 → 14 → 6 → 11 → 7 → 4 → 1 → 13 → 12 → 15 → 3 → 10 → 8 → 5

This creates a more circular path.

**Answer:** 8, 10, 3, 12, 15, 13, 1, 4, 7, 11, 6, 14, 2, 9, 5
