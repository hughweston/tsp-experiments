I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point based on the image:

1. Point 1: (47, 247)
2. Point 2: (268, 79)
3. Point 3: (168, 378)
4. Point 4: (640, 179)
5. Point 5: (47, 347)
6. Point 6: (228, 127)
7. Point 7: (118, 27)
8. Point 8: (388, 207)
9. Point 9: (658, 337)
10. Point 10: (308, 267)
11. Point 11: (148, 378)
12. Point 12: (178, 147)
13. Point 13: (38, 287)
14. Point 14: (348, 267)
15. Point 15: (528, 327)
16. Point 16: (618, 167)
17. Point 17: (168, 227)
18. Point 18: (688, 227)
19. Point 19: (508, 167)
20. Point 20: (48, 107)
21. Point 21: (448, 117)
22. Point 22: (528, 47)
23. Point 23: (88, 147)
24. Point 24: (588, 327)
25. Point 25: (598, 77)

Now I'll construct a tour by trying to connect nearby points in a logical path that minimizes backtracking.

Starting from the leftmost points and working around:

Looking at the layout, I can identify clusters and create a smooth path:
- Left side: 5, 13, 1, 17, 11, 3
- Upper left: 20, 23, 12, 6, 7
- Middle: 2, 21, 8, 10, 14
- Right upper: 22, 25, 16, 4, 18, 19
- Right lower: 9, 24, 15

Let me trace a tour that forms a logical loop:

5 → 13 → 1 → 17 → 23 → 20 → 7 → 6 → 12 → 2 → 21 → 22 → 25 → 16 → 4 → 18 → 9 → 24 → 15 → 19 → 8 → 14 → 10 → 3 → 11 → back to 5

Let me verify this makes a good path by checking the flow:
- 5(bottom left) → 13 → 1 → 17 → 23 → 20 → 7 (going up left side)
- 7 → 6 → 12 → 2 → 21 → 22 (moving right along top)
- 22 → 25 → 16 → 4 → 18 (right side upper to middle)
- 18 → 9 → 24 → 15 (right side going down then left)
- 15 → 19 → 8 → 14 → 10 (back toward middle)
- 10 → 3 → 11 → 5 (back to start)

**5, 13, 1, 17, 23, 20, 7, 6, 12, 2, 21, 22, 25, 16, 4, 18, 9, 24, 15, 19, 8, 14, 10, 3, 11**
