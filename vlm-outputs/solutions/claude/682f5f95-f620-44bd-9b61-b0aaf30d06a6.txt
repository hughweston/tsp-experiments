I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (108, 210)
- Point 2: (590, 470)
- Point 3: (168, 410)
- Point 4: (720, 400)
- Point 5: (700, 295)
- Point 6: (152, 45)
- Point 7: (408, 435)
- Point 8: (80, 75)
- Point 9: (215, 80)
- Point 10: (50, 305)
- Point 11: (270, 480)
- Point 12: (295, 190)
- Point 13: (700, 330)
- Point 14: (340, 490)
- Point 15: (430, 395)
- Point 16: (370, 210)
- Point 17: (350, 320)
- Point 18: (410, 155)
- Point 19: (680, 420)
- Point 20: (640, 325)

Let me construct a tour by finding nearby points and creating a logical path:

Starting from the top-left region and working around:
- Point 8 (top left) → Point 6 (nearby, top) → Point 9 (right of 6) → Point 12 → Point 18 → Point 16 → Point 17 → Point 15 → Point 7 → Point 14 → Point 11 → Point 3 → Point 10 → Point 1 → back up...

Let me try a more systematic approach, creating a roughly circular tour:

Upper region: 8 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 18 → 16
Right side: → 5 → 13 → 20 → 4 → 19 → 2
Bottom/middle: → 15 → 7 → 14 → 11 → 3
Left side: → 10 → 1 → back to 8

Let me refine this path:
8 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 18 → 16 → 17 → 5 → 20 → 13 → 4 → 19 → 2 → 15 → 7 → 14 → 11 → 3 → 10 → 1 → 8

Checking another route that might be shorter:
10 → 1 → 8 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 16 → 18 → 5 → 20 → 13 → 4 → 19 → 2 → 15 → 7 → 14 → 11 → 3 → 17 → 10

Let me optimize further by keeping nearby points together:
8 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 16 → 18 → 5 → 20 → 13 → 4 → 19 → 2 → 15 → 7 → 17 → 14 → 11 → 3 → 10 → 1 → 8

Refined tour:
1, 8, 6, 9, 12, 16, 18, 5, 20, 13, 4, 19, 2, 15, 7, 14, 11, 3, 10, 17

Wait, let me reconsider point 17's position - it's in the middle. Better placement:
1, 8, 6, 9, 12, 18, 16, 17, 15, 7, 14, 11, 3, 10, 2, 19, 4, 13, 20, 5

Let me try: 8, 6, 9, 1, 10, 3, 11, 14, 7, 17, 15, 2, 19, 4, 13, 20, 5, 18, 16, 12

**Answer:**
8, 6, 9, 12, 16, 18, 5, 20, 13, 4,
