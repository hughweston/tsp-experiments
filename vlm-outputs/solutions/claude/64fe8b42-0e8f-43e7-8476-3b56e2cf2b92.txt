I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (640, 73)
2: (755, 195)
3: (400, 108)
4: (410, 440)
5: (345, 425)
6: (190, 93)
7: (620, 255)
8: (480, 270)
9: (705, 80)
10: (455, 390)
11: (540, 168)
12: (660, 330)
13: (95, 295)
14: (330, 365)
15: (115, 385)
16: (660, 110)
17: (410, 285)
18: (305, 285)
19: (265, 160)
20: (530, 440)
21: (530, 340)
22: (100, 45)
23: (130, 195)
24: (165, 340)
25: (520, 53)

Let me find a good tour by analyzing clusters and proximity:

Starting from point 22 (top left), I'll try to create a logical path:

Upper region: 22 → 6 → 19 → 23 → 13 → 15 → 24 → 14 → 18 → 5 → 4 → 10 → 20 → 21 → 12 → 2 → 7 → 8 → 17 → 11 → 3 → 25 → 1 → 16 → 9 → back to 22

Let me try to optimize by looking at the layout more carefully:

Left side going down: 22, 6, 19, 23, 13, 15, 24
Bottom-middle: 14, 18, 5, 4, 10, 20
Right side going up: 21, 12, 2, 7, 8, 17
Upper middle-right: 11, 3, 25, 1, 16, 9

Refined tour:
22 → 6 → 19 → 3 → 25 → 1 → 16 → 9 → 2 → 7 → 12 → 21 → 20 → 10 → 4 → 5 → 14 → 18 → 17 → 8 → 11 → 24 → 15 → 13 → 23 → 22

Let me reconsider for a smoother path:

22 → 6 → 23 → 19 → 3 → 11 → 25 → 1 → 16 → 9 → 2 → 7 → 12 → 21 → 20 → 10 → 4 → 5 → 14 → 18 → 17 → 8 → 24 → 15 → 13 → 22

Final optimized tour:

22, 6, 19, 23, 13, 15, 24, 14, 18, 5, 4, 10, 20, 21, 12, 2, 7, 8, 17, 11, 3, 25, 1, 16, 9
