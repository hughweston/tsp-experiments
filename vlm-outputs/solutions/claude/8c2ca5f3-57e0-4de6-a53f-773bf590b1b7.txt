I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 30 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point based on the image:

1. (168, 135)
2. (540, 180)
3. (428, 390)
4. (480, 355)
5. (368, 335)
6. (128, 350)
7. (178, 28)
8. (330, 270)
9. (378, 375)
10. (58, 315)
11. (448, 340)
12. (528, 355)
12. (528, 355)
13. (390, 105)
14. (628, 155)
15. (565, 50)
16. (548, 425)
17. (738, 245)
18. (238, 330)
19. (738, 25)
20. (308, 330)
21. (238, 75)
22. (688, 340)
23. (628, 340)
24. (628, 250)
25. (298, 195)
26. (478, 50)
27. (48, 245)
28. (128, 250)
29. (38, 190)
30. (520, 120)

Let me find a good tour by looking for nearest neighbors and optimizing:

Starting from the left side and working around:
- 7 (top left) → 21 → 1 → 25 → 13 → 26 → 15 → 19 → 14 → 30 → 2 → 24 → 17 → 22 → 23 → 12 → 16 → 4 → 11 → 3 → 9 → 5 → 20 → 18 → 8 → 6 → 10 → 27 → 29 → 28 → back to 7

Let me optimize this by looking at geographical clusters:

Upper left: 7, 21, 1, 29, 27, 28
Upper middle: 25, 13, 26
Upper right: 15, 19, 14, 30
Right side: 2, 24, 17, 22, 23
Lower right: 12, 16, 4, 11
Lower middle: 3, 9, 5, 20, 8, 18
Left: 6, 10

Optimized tour:
7 → 21 → 1 → 25 → 8 → 20 → 18 → 6 → 10 → 27 → 29 → 28 → 5 → 9 → 3 → 11 → 4 → 12 → 16 → 23 → 22 → 17 → 24 → 2 → 14 → 30 → 15 → 19 → 26 → 13 → 7

Let me reconsider for a smoother path:

7, 21, 13, 26, 15, 19, 14, 30, 2, 24, 17, 22, 23, 12, 16, 4, 11, 3, 9, 5, 20, 18, 8, 25, 1, 28, 27, 29, 10, 6

**Answer:**
7, 21, 13, 26, 15, 19, 14, 30, 2, 24, 17, 22, 23, 12, 16, 4, 11, 3, 9, 5, 20, 18, 6, 10, 27, 29, 28, 1, 25, 8
