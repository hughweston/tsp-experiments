I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point based on the image:

1. (520, 180)
2. (500, 340)
3. (560, 300)
4. (400, 120)
5. (160, 270)
6. (720, 290)
7. (430, 420)
8. (350, 290)
9. (190, 370)
10. (540, 80)
11. (720, 45)
12. (290, 140)
13. (470, 290)
14. (720, 440)
15. (150, 450)
16. (600, 350)
17. (660, 105)
18. (260, 320)
19. (310, 230)
20. (680, 270)
21. (360, 225)
22. (30, 240)
23. (30, 390)
24. (95, 400)
25. (390, 45)

Now I'll work out a short tour by connecting nearby points and avoiding crossings.

Starting from the top and working around:
- Top area: 25, 10, 11, 17
- Right side going down: 20, 6, 14, 16
- Middle-right: 3, 2, 7
- Bottom-left: 15, 24, 23, 22
- Left side going up: 5, 9, 18, 19, 8
- Middle area: 21, 13, 1, 4, 12

Let me trace a logical tour:
Starting at 11 (top right): 11 → 17 → 10 → 25 → 4 → 12 → 21 → 19 → 8 → 18 → 5 → 22 → 23 → 24 → 9 → 15 → 7 → 2 → 13 → 1 → 3 → 16 → 14 → 6 → 20 → back to 11

Let me verify and optimize:
- 11, 17, 10, 25, 4, 12 (top cluster)
- 12 → 19, 21, 8, 18 (middle-left)
- 18 → 5, 22, 23, 24, 9, 15 (left side down)
- 15 → 7, 2, 13, 1, 3, 16, 14, 6, 20, 17... 

Refined tour:
11 → 17 → 20 → 6 → 14 → 16 → 3 → 2 → 7 → 15 → 24 → 23 → 22 → 5 → 9 → 18 → 8 → 19 → 21 → 13 → 1 → 4 → 12 → 25 → 10 → 11

**Answer:**
11, 17, 20, 6, 14, 16, 3, 2, 7, 15, 24, 23, 22, 5, 9, 18, 8, 19, 21, 13, 1, 4, 12, 25, 10
