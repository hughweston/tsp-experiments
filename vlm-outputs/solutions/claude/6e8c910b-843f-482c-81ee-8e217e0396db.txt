I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (205, 247)
- Point 2: (270, 220)
- Point 3: (150, 410)
- Point 4: (80, 390)
- Point 5: (640, 345)
- Point 6: (540, 120)
- Point 7: (600, 230)
- Point 8: (590, 65)
- Point 9: (410, 285)
- Point 10: (320, 320)

Let me analyze the spatial layout:
- Left cluster: Points 3, 4 (bottom left)
- Center-left: Points 1, 2 (middle left)
- Center: Points 9, 10 (middle)
- Right side: Points 5, 7 (right middle)
- Top right: Points 6, 8 (upper right)

I'll try to find a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence.

Starting from point 4 (bottom left), a logical path would be:
- 4 → 3 (nearby, bottom left)
- 3 → 1 (move up)
- 1 → 2 (nearby)
- 2 → 10 (move right and down)
- 10 → 9 (nearby)
- 9 → 7 (move right)
- 7 → 5 (move down-right)
- 5 → 6 (move up)
- 6 → 8 (nearby, top right)
- 8 → back to 4

Let me verify this makes a reasonable loop: 4-3-1-2-10-9-7-5-6-8-4

Actually, let me reconsider the path from 5 to get back efficiently:
- After 5, going to 6, then 8, then back to 4 is a long jump.

Let me try: 4-3-1-2-10-9-5-7-6-8 and back to 4
Or: 8-6-7-5-9-10-2-1-3-4

Checking another route: 1-2-10-9-5-7-6-8 then back through 3-4-1
Path: 1-2-10-9-7-5 (no, 5 is below 7)

Let me try: 4-3-1-2-10-9-7-6-8-5 back to 4 (5 to 4 is very long)

Better: 3-4-1-2-10-9-7-5-6-8 back to 3
Or: 4-3-1-2-6-8-7-5-9-10 back to 4

Optimal looking path following the geography:
4 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 10 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 8 → back to 4

Wait, 9 to 5 skips logically. Let me reconsider:
4-3-1-2-10-9-7-5 then 5-6-8 back to 4 seems inefficient.

Try: 4-3-1-2-10-9-5-7-6-8 back to 4

Final answer: **4, 3, 1, 2, 10, 9, 5, 7, 6, 8**
