I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (540, 295)
2. (540, 190)
3. (620, 220)
4. (720, 135)
5. (285, 180)
6. (450, 80)
7. (380, 205)
8. (30, 295)
9. (255, 390)
10. (190, 320)
11. (365, 290)
12. (115, 385)
13. (320, 55)
14. (755, 25)
15. (750, 255)
16. (280, 420)
17. (665, 255)
18. (735, 210)
19. (680, 95)
20. (140, 30)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and connections.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left: 20, 13
- Top right: 14, 19, 4
- Right side: 18, 15, 17, 3
- Center: 6, 2, 7, 5, 11, 1
- Left side: 8, 10, 12
- Bottom: 9, 16

Let me trace a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 8 (far left), I'll try to create a tour:
8 → 10 → 12 → 16 → 9 → 11 → 1 → 17 → 15 → 18 → 4 → 19 → 14 → 3 → 2 → 6 → 13 → 20 → 5 → 7 → back to 8

Let me reconsider by looking at a more circular path:

8 → 20 → 13 → 6 → 5 → 7 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 9 → 16 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 17 → 15 → 18 → 4 → 19 → 14 → back to 8

This seems inefficient. Let me try another approach:

Following a roughly circular tour:
20 → 13 → 6 → 2 → 19 → 14 → 4 → 18 → 15 → 17 → 3 → 1 → 11 → 7 → 5 → 10 → 8 → 12 → 9 → 16 → 20

Refining:
8 → 10 → 12 → 9 → 16 → 11 → 1 → 7 → 5 → 20 → 13 → 6 → 2 → 3 → 17 → 15 → 18 → 4 → 19 → 14 → back to 8

This path doesn't close well. Let me try:

20 → 8 → 10 → 12 → 9 → 16 → 11 → 1 → 17 → 15 → 18 → 4 → 14 → 19 → 3 → 2 → 6 → 13 → 5 → 7 → 20

**Answer:**
8, 20, 13, 6, 5, 7, 11, 10, 12, 9, 16, 1, 2, 3, 17, 15, 18, 4, 19, 14
