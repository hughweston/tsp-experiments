I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (25, 200)
- Point 2: (635, 270)
- Point 3: (480, 410)
- Point 4: (410, 250)
- Point 5: (45, 80)
- Point 6: (540, 75)
- Point 7: (340, 60)
- Point 8: (45, 480)
- Point 9: (250, 470)
- Point 10: (310, 490)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all these points. Let me analyze the positions:
- Points 5, 7, 6 are in the top region
- Point 1 is on the left side, middle height
- Point 4 is in the center
- Point 2 is on the right side
- Points 8, 9, 10, 3 are in the bottom region

Let me try to find a tour that doesn't have crossing paths:

Starting from point 1 (left middle), I'll try to make a logical loop:
- 1 → 5 (up to top left)
- 5 → 7 (across top)
- 7 → 6 (continue top right)
- 6 → 2 (down right side)
- 2 → 3 (down to bottom right area)
- 3 → 10 (left along bottom)
- 10 → 9 (continue left)
- 9 → 8 (to bottom left)
- 8 → 1 (up left side)

Wait, I missed point 4. Let me reconsider:

1 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 10 → 9 → 8 → 1

Let me check another route:
1 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 4 → 2 → 3 → 10 → 9 → 8 → 1

Or perhaps:
1 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 7 → 5 → 1

This creates a smooth loop going counterclockwise.

Let me verify this makes sense geographically:
- 1 (left middle) → 8 (bottom left) → 9 (bottom middle-left) → 10 (bottom middle) → 3 (bottom right area) → 2 (right side) → 4 (center) → 6 (top right) → 7 (top middle) → 5 (top left) → back to 1

This seems like a good tour without major crossings.
