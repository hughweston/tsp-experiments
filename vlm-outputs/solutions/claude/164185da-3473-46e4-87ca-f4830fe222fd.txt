I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (595, 355)
- Point 2: (590, 420)
- Point 3: (480, 355)
- Point 4: (645, 135)
- Point 5: (255, 430)
- Point 6: (30, 95)
- Point 7: (580, 295)
- Point 8: (425, 270)
- Point 9: (285, 320)
- Point 10: (25, 250)
- Point 11: (595, 55)
- Point 12: (300, 395)
- Point 13: (320, 165)
- Point 14: (150, 30)
- Point 15: (400, 440)
- Point 16: (390, 135)
- Point 17: (130, 320)
- Point 18: (200, 270)
- Point 19: (115, 390)
- Point 20: (500, 185)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and nearby connections.

Looking at the layout, I can identify some clusters:
- Top right: 11, 4
- Top left: 14, 6
- Left side: 10, 17, 18, 19
- Bottom middle: 5, 12, 15
- Right side: 1, 2, 7, 3
- Center/upper middle: 13, 16, 20, 8, 9

Let me trace a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from 14 (top left), going to nearby 6, then down to 10, 17, 18, 19, 5, 12, 15, 2, 1, 7, 3, 20, 4, 11, back across to 16, 13, 8, 9, and back to 14.

Let me refine this:
14 → 6 → 10 → 17 → 19 → 5 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 1 → 7 → 3 → 20 → 4 → 11 → 16 → 13 → 8 → 9 → 18 → back to 14

Wait, let me reconsider the path to make it smoother:

6 → 14 → 11 → 4 → 20 → 16 → 13 → 8 → 7 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 15 → 12 → 5 → 9 → 18 → 17 → 19 → 10 → 6

Let me optimize further:
14 → 6 → 10 → 17 → 18 → 9 → 5 → 19 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 1 → 7 → 3 → 8 → 20 → 4 → 11 → 16 → 13 → 14

Reconsidering the bottom section and connections:
6, 14, 13, 16, 11, 4, 20, 7, 1, 2, 15, 3, 8, 12, 5, 9, 18, 17, 19, 10

**Answer:**
6, 14, 13, 16, 11, 4, 20, 7, 1, 2, 15, 12, 5, 19, 17, 10, 18, 9, 8, 3
