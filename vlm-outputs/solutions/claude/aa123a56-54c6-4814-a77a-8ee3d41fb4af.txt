I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (480, 310)
2. (140, 135)
3. (580, 270)
4. (540, 180)
5. (250, 105)
6. (720, 400)
7. (500, 340)
8. (740, 210)
9. (145, 75)
10. (250, 45)
11. (555, 120)
12. (450, 340)
13. (640, 235)
14. (720, 65)
15. (660, 400)
16. (120, 435)
17. (45, 105)
18. (710, 445)
19. (290, 105)
20. (720, 130)

Now I'll find a short tour by analyzing the positions and connecting nearby points.

Looking at the layout:
- Left side cluster: 17, 9, 2, 10, 5, 19
- Middle area: 12, 7, 1
- Upper right diagonal: 11, 4, 3, 13, 8, 20, 14
- Lower right: 15, 6, 18
- Bottom left: 16

Let me trace a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from the top-left and working around:
- 17 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 19 (top left cluster)
- 19 → 11 → 4 → 14 → 20 → 8 (upper right)
- 8 → 13 → 3 → 6 → 18 → 15 (right side down)
- 15 → 7 → 1 → 12 (middle)
- 12 → 16 → 2 → 17 (back to left)

Let me refine this:
17 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 19 → 11 → 4 → 14 → 20 → 8 → 13 → 3 → 6 → 18 → 15 → 7 → 1 → 12 → 16 → 2 → 17

Checking another route to optimize:
17 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 19 → 11 → 4 → 14 → 20 → 8 → 13 → 3 → 6 → 18 → 15 → 7 → 1 → 12 → 16 → 17

Let me reconsider the path through the middle and bottom:
16 is isolated at bottom left, so should connect to 2/17 area and to 12.

Final optimized tour:
17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 2, 16, 12, 7, 1, 3, 13, 8, 20, 14, 11, 4, 6, 18, 15

Wait, let me re-examine: 4 is between 11 and 3, not near 6.

Better route:
17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 11, 4, 14, 20, 8, 13, 3, 6, 18, 15, 7, 1, 12, 16, 2

**Answer:**
17, 9, 10, 5, 19, 11, 4, 14, 20, 8, 13, 3, 6, 18, 15, 7, 1, 12, 16, 2
