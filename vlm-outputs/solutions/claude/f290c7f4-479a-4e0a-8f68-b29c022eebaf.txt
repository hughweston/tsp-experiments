I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (318, 468)
- Point 2: (168, 438)
- Point 3: (108, 78)
- Point 4: (678, 248)
- Point 5: (408, 268)
- Point 6: (285, 48)
- Point 7: (338, 228)
- Point 8: (648, 288)
- Point 9: (478, 408)
- Point 10: (168, 38)
- Point 11: (448, 68)
- Point 12: (258, 268)
- Point 13: (628, 488)
- Point 14: (48, 378)
- Point 15: (228, 298)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the spatial distribution and trying to create a path that doesn't cross itself.

Looking at the layout:
- Top region: 10, 3, 6, 11
- Middle-left region: 14, 2, 15, 12
- Middle-center: 7, 5
- Middle-right: 4, 8
- Bottom region: 1, 9, 13

Let me try to construct a tour that forms a logical loop:

Starting from the top-left and going around:
- 10 → 3 (nearby, top-left)
- 3 → 6 (move right along top)
- 6 → 11 (continue right along top)
- 11 → 4 (down to right side)
- 4 → 8 (nearby on right)
- 8 → 13 (down right side)
- 13 → 9 (left along bottom)
- 9 → 1 (continue left)
- 1 → 2 (left side)
- 2 → 14 (far left)
- 14 → 15 (up from 14)
- 15 → 12 (nearby)
- 12 → 7 (nearby)
- 7 → 5 (nearby)
- 5 → back to 10

Let me verify this makes a reasonable loop: 10 → 3 → 6 → 11 → 4 → 8 → 13 → 9 → 1 → 2 → 14 → 15 → 12 → 7 → 5 → 10

This creates a roughly circular path. Let me check if adjustments improve it.

Considering the positions more carefully, connecting 5 back to 10 is a long jump. Let me try:
10 → 6 → 11 → 4 → 8 → 13 → 9 → 1 → 2 → 14 → 15 → 12 → 7 → 5 → 3 → 10

Actually, let me reconsider: 3 → 10 → 6 → 11 → 4 → 8 → 13 → 9 → 1 → 2 → 14 → 15 → 12 → 7 → 5 → 3

This seems more efficient as 5 to 3 and 3 to 10 are reasonable distances.

**Final Answer:**
3, 10, 6, 11, 4, 8, 13, 9, 1, 2, 14, 15, 12, 7, 5
