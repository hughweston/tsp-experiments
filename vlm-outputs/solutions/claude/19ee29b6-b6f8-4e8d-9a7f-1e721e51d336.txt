I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (247, 457)
2. (272, 52)
3. (753, 287)
4. (96, 352)
5. (388, 47)
6. (702, 67)
7. (64, 377)
8. (711, 192)
9. (673, 407)
10. (47, 42)
11. (738, 117)
12. (527, 317)
13. (608, 422)
14. (628, 297)
15. (718, 257)
16. (208, 252)
17. (298, 82)
18. (588, 377)
19. (27, 432)
20. (478, 377)
21. (528, 287)
22. (228, 152)
23. (438, 317)
24. (408, 347)
25. (188, 412)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the spatial distribution and connecting nearby points.

Starting from the top-left and trying to create a logical path:

Looking at clusters:
- Top left: 10
- Top middle: 2, 17, 5
- Top right: 6, 11, 8
- Right side: 15, 3, 14, 9, 13, 18
- Middle: 21, 12, 23, 24, 20
- Left side: 22, 16, 4, 7, 19, 25, 1

Let me trace a tour that minimizes backtracking:

10 → 22 → 17 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 11 → 8 → 15 → 3 → 14 → 9 → 13 → 18 → 20 → 24 → 23 → 21 → 12 → 16 → 4 → 7 → 19 → 25 → 1 → back to 10

Let me reconsider to optimize:

10 → 2 → 17 → 22 → 16 → 4 → 7 → 19 → 25 → 1 → 24 → 23 → 20 → 18 → 13 → 9 → 3 → 15 → 14 → 21 → 12 → 8 → 11 → 6 → 5 → 10

Better approach - going around the perimeter and handling interior:

10 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 11 → 8 → 15 → 3 → 14 → 9 → 13 → 18 → 20 → 24 → 23 → 21 → 12 → 1 → 25 → 19 → 7 → 4 → 16 → 22 → 17 → 10

Let me refine:

10 → 17 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 11 → 8 → 15 → 3 → 14 → 21 → 12 → 18 → 9 → 13 → 20 → 24 → 23 → 1 → 25 → 19 → 7 → 4 → 16 → 22 → 10

**Answer:**
10, 17, 2, 5, 6, 11, 8, 15, 3, 14, 21, 12, 18, 9, 13, 20, 24, 23, 1, 25, 19, 7, 4, 16, 22
