I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (77, 107)
2. (545, 78)
3. (187, 298)
4. (47, 378)
5. (27, 338)
6. (270, 68)
7. (400, 128)
8. (197, 388)
9. (623, 328)
10. (47, 158)
11. (678, 308)
12. (593, 198)
13. (207, 368)
14. (257, 428)
15. (320, 28)
16. (523, 328)
17. (728, 338)
18. (480, 58)
19. (137, 178)
20. (77, 378)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the geographic clusters and connections:

Left cluster: 1, 10, 19, 5, 4, 20, 8, 13, 3, 14
Top cluster: 6, 15, 18, 2, 7
Right cluster: 12, 9, 11, 17, 16

Let me trace a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 1, going through nearby points:
- 1 → 10 (close, left side)
- 10 → 19 (nearby)
- 19 → 3 (moving down)
- 3 → 5 (left side)
- 5 → 4 (close)
- 4 → 20 (adjacent)
- 20 → 8 (close)
- 8 → 13 (adjacent)
- 13 → 14 (close)
- 14 → 16 (moving right)
- 16 → 9 (right cluster)
- 9 → 17 (far right)
- 17 → 11 (close)
- 11 → 12 (up)
- 12 → 2 (upper right)
- 2 → 18 (close)
- 18 → 7 (close)
- 7 → 15 (top)
- 15 → 6 (close)
- 6 → 1 (back to start)

Let me verify and optimize this tour:

1 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 20 → 8 → 13 → 14 → 3 → 19 → 6 → 15 → 18 → 7 → 2 → 12 → 11 → 17 → 9 → 16 → back to 1

Actually, let me reconsider for a better path:

1 → 19 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 20 → 8 → 13 → 3 → 14 → 16 → 9 → 17 → 11 → 12 → 2 → 18 → 7 → 15 → 6 → 1

**1, 6, 15, 18, 2, 12, 11, 17, 9, 16, 7, 14, 8, 13, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10, 19**
