I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point based on the image:
- Point 1: (470, 47)
- Point 2: (565, 235)
- Point 3: (215, 225)
- Point 4: (205, 37)
- Point 5: (18, 295)
- Point 6: (220, 310)
- Point 7: (730, 355)
- Point 8: (430, 220)
- Point 9: (700, 165)
- Point 10: (680, 355)
- Point 11: (620, 370)
- Point 12: (28, 385)
- Point 13: (295, 400)
- Point 14: (70, 305)
- Point 15: (105, 390)

Let me try to find a good tour by connecting nearby points and avoiding crossing paths.

Starting from the top and working around:
- Point 4 (top left) → Point 1 (top right)
- Point 1 → Point 9 (right side, upper)
- Point 9 → Point 2 (middle right area)
- Point 2 → Point 7 (far right)
- Point 7 → Point 10 (near 7)
- Point 10 → Point 11 (nearby)
- Point 11 → Point 13 (lower middle)
- Point 13 → Point 15 (left side lower)
- Point 15 → Point 12 (left edge)
- Point 12 → Point 14 (left side)
- Point 14 → Point 5 (left edge upper)
- Point 5 → Point 6 (middle left)
- Point 6 → Point 3 (above 6)
- Point 3 → Point 8 (middle)
- Point 8 → Point 4 (back to start)

Let me reconsider for a more efficient path:

4 → 1 → 9 → 2 → 8 → 3 → 6 → 5 → 14 → 12 → 15 → 13 → 11 → 10 → 7 → back to 4

Or trying a cleaner loop:
4 → 1 → 9 → 7 → 10 → 11 → 2 → 8 → 3 → 6 → 13 → 15 → 12 → 14 → 5 → 4

Let me trace a path that forms a logical circuit:
Starting from 4, going clockwise roughly:
4 → 1 → 9 → 7 → 10 → 11 → 13 → 15 → 12 → 14 → 5 → 6 → 3 → 8 → 2 → back to 4

This seems to cross. Let me try:
4 → 3 → 8 → 1 → 9 → 2 → 7 → 10 → 11 → 13 → 15 → 12 → 14 → 5 → 6 → 4

**4, 1, 9, 2, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 12, 14, 5, 6, 3, 8**
