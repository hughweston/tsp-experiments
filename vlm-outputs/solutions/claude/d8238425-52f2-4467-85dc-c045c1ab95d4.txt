I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 30 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (520, 295)
2: (480, 190)
3: (295, 230)
4: (390, 65)
5: (730, 250)
6: (670, 230)
7: (270, 410)
8: (30, 80)
9: (45, 410)
10: (710, 190)
11: (150, 370)
12: (250, 230)
13: (620, 385)
14: (65, 220)
15: (580, 150)
16: (25, 350)
17: (455, 75)
18: (450, 145)
19: (115, 35)
20: (340, 110)
21: (390, 275)
22: (310, 355)
23: (590, 80)
24: (655, 175)
25: (720, 190)
26: (480, 390)
27: (225, 385)
28: (355, 175)
29: (210, 275)
30: (530, 80)

Let me construct a tour by finding nearby points and creating a logical path:

Starting from the top-left and working around:
- 19 (top left) → 8 (nearby) → 14 → 16 → 9 → 11 → 27 → 7 → 22 → 26 → 13 → 1 → 21 → 3 → 12 → 29 → 28 → 2 → 18 → 15 → 24 → 10 → 25 → 6 → 5 → 23 → 30 → 17 → 4 → 20 → back to 19

Let me refine this by checking geographical clusters:

Top region: 19, 8, 4, 17, 30, 23, 20
Right side: 24, 10, 25, 6, 5, 15
Middle: 18, 2, 28, 3, 12, 21, 1
Bottom: 13, 26, 22, 7, 27, 11, 9, 16
Left: 14, 29

Optimized tour following a roughly circular path:

8 → 19 → 4 → 20 → 28 → 18 → 17 → 30 → 23 → 15 → 24 → 10 → 25 → 6 → 5 → 13 → 26 → 1 → 21 → 2 → 3 → 12 → 29 → 22 → 7 → 27 → 11 → 9 → 16 → 14 → 8

**Final Answer:**
8, 19, 4, 20, 28, 18, 17, 30, 23, 15, 24, 10, 25, 6, 5, 13, 26, 1, 21, 2, 3, 12, 29, 22, 7, 27, 11, 9, 16, 14
