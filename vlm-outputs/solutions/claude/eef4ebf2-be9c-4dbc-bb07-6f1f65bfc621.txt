I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. Point 1: (550, 330)
2. Point 2: (47, 390)
3. Point 3: (410, 245)
4. Point 4: (47, 215)
5. Point 5: (205, 75)
6. Point 6: (340, 450)
7. Point 7: (160, 380)
8. Point 8: (430, 330)
9. Point 9: (155, 215)
10. Point 10: (450, 365)
11. Point 11: (540, 105)
12. Point 12: (250, 300)
13. Point 13: (670, 120)
14. Point 14: (620, 240)
15. Point 15: (480, 135)
16. Point 16: (700, 240)
17. Point 17: (350, 45)
18. Point 18: (120, 305)
19. Point 19: (620, 440)
20. Point 20: (435, 275)

Now I'll find a short tour by analyzing the positions and using nearest neighbor heuristic, then improving it.

Starting from point 2 (bottom left) and moving logically:
- 2 → 4 (nearby, upper left)
- 4 → 9 (nearby)
- 9 → 5 (move up)
- 5 → 17 (nearby at top)
- 17 → 11 (move right along top)
- 11 → 15 (nearby)
- 15 → 13 (continue right)
- 13 → 16 (nearby)
- 16 → 14 (down slightly)
- 14 → 1 (move down)
- 1 → 19 (bottom right area)
- 19 → 10 (move up)
- 10 → 8 (nearby)
- 8 → 20 (nearby)
- 20 → 3 (nearby)
- 3 → 12 (move left)
- 12 → 18 (continue left)
- 18 → 7 (nearby)
- 7 → 6 (move right to bottom)
- 6 → back to 2

Let me verify and optimize this route by checking for crossing paths:

A better tour considering geographical clustering:
2 → 7 → 18 → 4 → 9 → 12 → 5 → 17 → 15 → 11 → 13 → 16 → 14 → 1 → 19 → 10 → 6 → 8 → 20 → 3 → 2

Refining further:
2 → 4 → 9 → 18 → 7 → 12 → 6 → 10 → 19 → 1 → 14 → 16 → 13 → 11 → 15 → 17 → 5 → 3 → 20 → 8 → 2

Let me reconsider for a cleaner path:
2 → 7 → 6 → 19 → 1 → 10 → 8 → 20 → 3 → 14 → 16 → 13 → 11 → 15 → 17 → 5 → 9 → 4 → 18 → 12 → 2

**Answer:**
2, 4, 9, 5, 17, 15, 11, 13, 16, 14, 1, 19, 10, 8, 20, 3, 6, 7, 12, 18
