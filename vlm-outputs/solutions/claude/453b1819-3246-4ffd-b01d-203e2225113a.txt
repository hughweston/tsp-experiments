I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (168, 468)
2: (480, 478)
3: (620, 95)
4: (530, 205)
5: (270, 255)
6: (600, 410)
7: (95, 330)
8: (410, 440)
9: (225, 235)
10: (560, 480)
11: (28, 365)
12: (380, 295)
13: (680, 185)
14: (500, 115)
15: (480, 55)
16: (50, 175)
17: (750, 60)
18: (695, 245)
19: (310, 320)
20: (60, 245)
21: (160, 190)
22: (270, 405)
23: (270, 45)
24: (580, 315)
25: (230, 345)

Let me work out a good tour by considering geographical clusters and connections:

Starting from the left side and working around:
- Bottom left area: 11, 7, 20, 16
- Upper left: 21, 9, 5
- Top area: 23, 15, 14, 3, 17
- Right side: 13, 18, 4, 24, 6
- Bottom right: 10, 2, 8
- Middle/left: 22, 19, 12, 25, 1

Let me trace a logical path:
1 → 22 → 25 → 7 → 11 → 20 → 16 → 21 → 9 → 5 → 23 → 15 → 14 → 3 → 17 → 13 → 18 → 4 → 24 → 6 → 10 → 2 → 8 → 12 → 19 → 1

Let me refine this by looking at the layout more carefully:

Going clockwise from point 1:
1 → 22 → 8 → 2 → 10 → 6 → 24 → 18 → 13 → 17 → 3 → 14 → 15 → 23 → 21 → 16 → 20 → 7 → 11 → 25 → 19 → 12 → 5 → 9 → 4

Let me try another approach, minimizing backtracking:
11 → 7 → 20 → 16 → 21 → 9 → 5 → 23 → 15 → 14 → 3 → 17 → 13 → 18 → 4 → 24 → 6 → 10 → 2 → 8 → 12 → 19 → 22 → 25 → 1

Refining further:
1 → 25 → 22 → 19 → 12 → 8 → 2 → 10 → 6 → 24 → 18 → 13 → 17 → 3 → 14 → 15 → 23 → 21 → 9 → 5 → 16 → 20 → 7 → 11 → 4

Let me reconsider with better clustering:
11 → 7 → 20 → 16 → 21 → 9 → 5 → 25 → 19 → 22 → 1 → 8 → 2 → 10 → 6 → 24 → 12 → 4 → 18 → 13 → 17 → 3 → 14 → 15 → 23

**1, 22, 25, 19, 12, 8, 2, 10, 6, 24, 18, 13, 17, 3, 14, 15, 23, 21, 9, 5, 16, 20, 7, 11, 4**
