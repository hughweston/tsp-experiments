I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (480, 178)
2. (705, 248)
3. (480, 298)
4. (245, 328)
5. (500, 150)
6. (250, 150)
7. (255, 68)
8. (560, 408)
9. (50, 388)
10. (620, 398)
11. (410, 378)
12. (645, 338)
13. (520, 378)
14. (95, 348)
15. (185, 418)
16. (355, 368)
17. (165, 338)
18. (245, 358)
19. (390, 58)
20. (670, 198)

Now I'll find a short tour by identifying clusters and connecting them efficiently.

Looking at the layout:
- Top cluster: 7, 6, 19, 5
- Right side: 20, 2, 12, 10
- Middle-right: 1, 3, 8, 13
- Left cluster: 9, 14, 17, 4, 18, 15
- Center: 11, 16

Let me trace a logical path:

Starting from 7 (top left), going to nearby points:
7 → 6 → 19 → 5 → 1 → 20 → 2 → 12 → 10 → 8 → 13 → 3 → 11 → 16 → 18 → 4 → 17 → 14 → 9 → 15 → back to 7

Let me reconsider for a better route by avoiding crossings:

7 → 19 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 20 → 2 → 12 → 10 → 8 → 13 → 11 → 16 → 18 → 15 → 9 → 14 → 17 → 4 → 6 → 7

Let me optimize further:

Starting from 9 (leftmost): 9 → 14 → 17 → 15 → 18 → 4 → 6 → 7 → 19 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 16 → 11 → 13 → 8 → 10 → 12 → 2 → 20 → back to route...

Better route considering geography:
7 → 6 → 4 → 17 → 14 → 9 → 15 → 18 → 16 → 11 → 13 → 8 → 10 → 12 → 2 → 20 → 1 → 5 → 19 → 3 → 7

Let me refine:
9 → 14 → 17 → 18 → 15 → 16 → 11 → 4 → 6 → 7 → 19 → 5 → 1 → 20 → 2 → 12 → 10 → 8 → 13 → 3 → 9

Final optimized tour:

**7, 19, 5, 1, 20, 2, 12, 10, 8, 13, 3, 11, 16, 18, 15, 9, 14, 17, 4, 6**
