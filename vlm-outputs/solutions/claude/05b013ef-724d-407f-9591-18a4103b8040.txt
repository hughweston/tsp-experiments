I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- 1: (95, 80)
- 2: (150, 455)
- 3: (505, 330)
- 4: (445, 150)
- 5: (500, 135)
- 6: (55, 400)
- 7: (300, 435)
- 8: (640, 355)
- 9: (365, 410)
- 10: (640, 70)
- 11: (70, 205)
- 12: (580, 355)
- 13: (280, 360)
- 14: (755, 70)
- 15: (215, 135)
- 16: (665, 50)
- 17: (95, 260)
- 18: (330, 250)
- 19: (700, 315)
- 20: (710, 355)
- 21: (480, 115)
- 22: (670, 305)
- 23: (185, 30)
- 24: (30, 450)
- 25: (595, 415)

Let me construct a tour by finding nearby points and creating a logical path:

Starting from the top and working around:
- 23 (top left) → 1 (nearby) → 15 → 11 → 17 → 6 → 24 → 2 → 7 → 9 → 13 → 18 → 3 → 12 → 25 → 8 → 20 → 19 → 22 → 14 → 16 → 10 → 21 → 5 → 4 → back to 23

Let me verify and optimize this route by checking geographical clusters:

Top area: 23, 1, 15, 21, 4, 5, 10, 16, 14
Left side: 11, 17, 6, 24
Bottom: 2, 7, 9, 13
Middle-right: 18, 3, 12, 25, 8, 20, 19, 22

Optimized tour:
23 → 1 → 15 → 11 → 17 → 6 → 24 → 2 → 7 → 9 → 13 → 18 → 4 → 21 → 5 → 3 → 12 → 25 → 8 → 20 → 19 → 22 → 14 → 16 → 10 → 23

Let me reconsider the right side connections:
10 → 16 → 14 → 22 → 19 → 20 → 8 → 25 → 12 → 3 → 5 → 21 → 4

Final optimized tour:
23, 1, 15, 4, 21, 5, 10, 16, 14, 22, 19, 20, 8, 25, 12, 3, 9, 7, 2, 24, 6, 17, 11, 18, 13

Wait, let me recalculate for better optimization:

**1, 23, 15, 11, 17, 6, 24, 2, 7, 9, 13, 18, 3, 12, 25, 8, 20, 19, 22, 14, 16, 10, 5, 21, 4**
