I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 30 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point from the image:

- Top region: 26, 23, 28, 25, 8, 1, 21, 2
- Upper-middle: 6, 7, 30, 22, 4, 17, 13, 11
- Middle: 20, 5, 9
- Lower region: 27, 16, 12, 3, 18, 14, 19, 15
- Bottom: 29, 24, 10

Let me trace a path that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence:

Starting from the left side and working through clusters:

Left side: 30 → 25 → 26 → 23 → 8 → 6 → 7
Then moving right along top: 22 → 4 → 1 → 21 → 28 → 2 → 13 → 17 → 11 → 9
Then down to lower right: 19 → 15 → 18 → 14 → 3 → 12 → 16 → 10 → 24 → 29 → 27
Back to 30

Let me reconsider the positions more carefully and optimize:

Following a more logical geographic tour:
- Start at 25 (far left upper), go to 30 (left middle)
- 27 (lower left), 29, 24, 10, 16, 12, 3, 14, 18, 15, 19, 9, 11, 13, 17, 4, 22, 5, 20, 7, 6, 8, 23, 26, 25... 

Let me try a cleaner approach following the perimeter and filling in:

25, 30, 27, 29, 24, 10, 16, 12, 3, 14, 18, 15, 19, 9, 11, 2, 28, 21, 1, 13, 17, 4, 22, 5, 20, 7, 6, 8, 23, 26

Checking this creates a reasonable tour without too many crossings.

**Answer:**
25, 26, 23, 8, 6, 7, 30, 27, 29, 24, 10, 16, 12, 20, 5, 22, 4, 3, 14, 18, 15, 19, 9, 11, 2, 28, 21, 1, 13, 17
