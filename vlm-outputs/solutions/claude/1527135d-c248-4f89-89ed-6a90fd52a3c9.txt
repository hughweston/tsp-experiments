I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (213, 247)
2. (468, 247)
3. (705, 437)
4. (570, 87)
5. (140, 37)
6. (620, 417)
7. (753, 267)
8. (730, 97)
9. (730, 317)
10. (500, 137)
11. (713, 277)
12. (563, 467)
20. (430, 467)
13. (350, 307)
14. (270, 307)
15. (190, 247)
16. (460, 157)
17. (420, 307)
18. (380, 247)
19. (545, 317)
21. (573, 247)
22. (390, 87)
23. (650, 77)
24. (220, 377)
25. (30, 37)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by identifying clusters and connecting them efficiently.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left: 25, 5
- Top middle: 22, 4, 10, 16
- Top right: 23, 8
- Middle left: 15, 1, 14, 24
- Middle center: 18, 2, 13, 17
- Middle right: 21, 19, 11, 7, 9
- Bottom: 20, 12, 6, 3

Let me trace a logical path:

Starting from 25 (top left): 25 → 5 → 22 → 4 → 23 → 8 → 7 → 11 → 9 → 3 → 6 → 12 → 20 → 19 → 21 → 2 → 17 → 13 → 18 → 16 → 10 → 1 → 15 → 14 → 24 → back to 25

Let me refine this by checking the path more carefully:

25 → 5 → 22 → 16 → 10 → 4 → 23 → 8 → 7 → 11 → 9 → 3 → 6 → 12 → 20 → 24 → 14 → 15 → 1 → 18 → 13 → 17 → 2 → 19 → 21 → back to 25

Let me try another approach, connecting nearby points:

25, 5, 22, 4, 23, 8, 7, 11, 9, 3, 6, 12, 20, 19, 21, 2, 17, 13, 18, 16, 10, 1, 15, 14, 24

Final answer:

**25, 5, 22, 4, 23, 8, 7, 11, 9, 3, 6, 12, 20, 24, 14, 15, 1, 18, 13, 17, 2, 19, 21, 10, 16**
