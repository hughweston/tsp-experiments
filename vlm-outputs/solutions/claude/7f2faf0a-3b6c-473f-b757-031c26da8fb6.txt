I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (410, 390)
- Point 2: (480, 400)
- Point 3: (135, 435)
- Point 4: (410, 240)
- Point 5: (280, 400)
- Point 6: (400, 450)
- Point 7: (710, 100)
- Point 8: (545, 380)
- Point 9: (295, 255)
- Point 10: (700, 45)
- Point 11: (475, 270)
- Point 12: (680, 155)
- Point 13: (720, 380)
- Point 14: (65, 80)
- Point 15: (665, 95)
- Point 16: (175, 335)
- Point 17: (310, 310)
- Point 18: (400, 55)
- Point 19: (555, 175)
- Point 20: (85, 350)

Let me work out a tour by connecting nearby points and avoiding crossings.

Starting from point 14 (top left), I'll try to create a logical path:
- 14 (top left) → 18 (top middle) → 10 (top right) → 7 → 15 → 12 → 19 → 13 (right side) → 8 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 3 → 20 → 16 → 17 → 9 → 4 → 11 → back to 14

Let me reconsider for a better route, grouping by regions:

Top region: 14, 18, 10, 7, 15, 12
Right-middle: 19, 13, 8
Bottom-middle: 2, 6, 1, 5
Left side: 3, 20, 16
Middle: 9, 17, 4, 11

Trying a tour:
14 → 18 → 10 → 7 → 15 → 12 → 19 → 11 → 4 → 9 → 17 → 5 → 1 → 6 → 2 → 8 → 13 → 3 → 20 → 16 → 14

Wait, that doesn't connect well. Let me reconsider:

14 → 18 → 10 → 7 → 15 → 12 → 19 → 13 → 8 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 17 → 9 → 4 → 11 → 16 → 20 → 3 → 14

Better path considering distances:
14 → 18 → 10 → 7 → 15 → 12 → 19 → 11 → 4 → 9 → 17 → 16 → 20 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 8 → 13 → 14

This doesn't close well. Final attempt:

3 → 20 → 16 → 14 → 18 → 10 → 7 → 15 → 12 → 19 → 13 → 8 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 17 → 9 → 4 → 11

**14, 18, 10, 7, 15, 12, 19, 11, 4, 9, 17, 16, 20, 3, 5, 6, 1, 2, 8, 13**
