I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (640, 190)
2. (95, 295)
3. (270, 355)
4. (480, 410)
5. (270, 190)
6. (100, 65)
7. (135, 435)
8. (25, 400)
9. (705, 295)
10. (80, 105)
11. (600, 365)
12. (305, 365)
13. (720, 390)
14. (410, 345)
15. (200, 415)
16. (530, 270)
17. (145, 40)
18. (720, 65)
19. (380, 240)
20. (150, 100)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and nearby points.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left cluster: 6, 17, 10, 20
- Left side: 2, 8, 7, 15
- Center: 5, 3, 12, 14, 19
- Right side: 1, 18, 9, 13, 11, 16
- Bottom center: 4

Let me trace a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 17 (top left area):
17 → 6 → 10 → 20 → 5 → 19 → 16 → 1 → 18 → 9 → 13 → 11 → 4 → 14 → 12 → 3 → 15 → 7 → 8 → 2 → back to 17

Let me verify this makes geographic sense:
- 17, 6, 10, 20 (top left cluster)
- 20 → 5 (moving right)
- 5 → 19 → 16 → 1 (diagonal toward right)
- 1 → 18 (up to top right)
- 18 → 9 → 13 (down right side)
- 13 → 11 → 4 (moving left)
- 4 → 14 → 12 → 3 (center area)
- 3 → 15 → 7 → 8 (down and left)
- 8 → 2 → 17 (back up left side)

This seems like a reasonable tour following the perimeter and connecting clusters efficiently.

**Answer:**
17, 6, 10, 20, 5, 19, 16, 1, 18, 9, 13, 11, 4, 14, 12, 3, 15, 7, 8, 2
