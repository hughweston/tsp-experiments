I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. Point 1: (295, 295)
2. Point 2: (360, 450)
3. Point 3: (640, 190)
4. Point 4: (620, 50)
5. Point 5: (135, 400)
6. Point 6: (755, 270)
7. Point 7: (480, 450)
8. Point 8: (225, 35)
9. Point 9: (60, 210)
10. Point 10: (25, 355)
11. Point 11: (270, 365)
12. Point 12: (530, 170)
13. Point 13: (470, 365)
14. Point 14: (645, 410)
15. Point 15: (200, 450)
16. Point 16: (470, 35)
17. Point 17: (190, 265)
18. Point 18: (110, 130)
19. Point 19: (500, 90)
20. Point 20: (700, 350)

Now I'll find a short tour by identifying clusters and connecting them efficiently.

Looking at the layout:
- Left side: 10, 9, 18, 8, 17, 5, 15
- Center-left: 1, 11, 2
- Top: 8, 16, 19, 4
- Right side: 3, 6, 20, 14
- Center: 12, 13, 7

Let me trace a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 8 (top left), going clockwise:
8 → 18 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 15 → 2 → 11 → 1 → 17 → (back to center) → 7 → 13 → 14 → 20 → 6 → 3 → 12 → 19 → 4 → 16 → 8

Let me refine this:

8 → 16 → 19 → 4 → 3 → 12 → 6 → 20 → 14 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 15 → 5 → 11 → 1 → 17 → 9 → 10 → 18 → 8

Checking another arrangement:
10 → 9 → 18 → 8 → 16 → 19 → 4 → 3 → 12 → 6 → 20 → 14 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 15 → 5 → 11 → 1 → 17 → 10

Let me optimize further by checking nearby connections:

8 → 18 → 9 → 10 → 17 → 5 → 15 → 11 → 1 → 2 → 7 → 13 → 14 → 20 → 6 → 3 → 12 → 19 → 4 → 16 → 8

This seems like a good tour following a logical path.

**Answer:**
8, 16, 4, 19, 12, 3, 6, 20, 14, 7, 13, 2, 15, 5, 11, 1, 17, 10, 9, 18
