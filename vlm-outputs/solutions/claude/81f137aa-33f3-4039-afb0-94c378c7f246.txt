I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (30, 120)
- Point 2: (720, 430)
- Point 3: (620, 80)
- Point 4: (45, 25)
- Point 5: (270, 390)
- Point 6: (80, 300)
- Point 7: (680, 370)
- Point 8: (35, 340)
- Point 9: (530, 50)
- Point 10: (95, 210)

Now I need to find a tour that minimizes total distance. Let me analyze the positions:
- Points 4, 1, 10, 6, 8 are on the left side
- Point 5 is in the middle-bottom
- Points 9, 3 are in the upper-right area
- Points 7, 2 are in the lower-right area

A good strategy is to follow a roughly circular path around the perimeter.

Let me trace a logical tour:
- Start at 4 (top-left)
- Go to 1 (below 4, left side)
- Go to 10 (below 1, left side)
- Go to 6 (below 10, left side)
- Go to 8 (below 6, left side)
- Go to 5 (middle-bottom)
- Go to 2 (bottom-right)
- Go to 7 (above 2, right side)
- Go to 3 (upper-right)
- Go to 9 (upper area, near 3)
- Return to 4

Let me verify this makes a reasonable circuit: 4 → 1 → 10 → 6 → 8 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 4

This follows the left edge down, crosses to the right at the bottom, goes up the right side, and returns across the top.

Let me check if 9 → 3 → 7 → 2 or 9 → 3 reversed makes more sense:
- 9 is at (530, 50), 3 is at (620, 80) - these are close together at the top
- Going 4 → 9 → 3 → 7 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 6 → 10 → 1 → 4

Actually, let me reconsider the top portion: 4 → 1 → 10 → 6 → 8 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 4 seems good but the return from 9 to 4 is long.

Better path: 4 → 9 → 3 → 7 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 6 → 10 → 1 → 4

This goes from top-left to top-right, down the right side, across the bottom, up the left side.
