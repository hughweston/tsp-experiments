I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (95, 410)
2. (350, 95)
3. (580, 295)
4. (560, 65)
5. (350, 245)
6. (150, 295)
7. (175, 130)
8. (640, 410)
9. (150, 430)
10. (230, 175)
11. (60, 115)
12. (280, 370)
13. (225, 45)
14. (500, 175)
15. (305, 175)
16. (305, 395)
17. (480, 410)
18. (420, 165)
19. (320, 85)
20. (205, 425)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the spatial distribution and using nearest neighbor heuristic with improvements.

Starting from point 11 (top left) and moving systematically:

Let me trace a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

- 11 (far left top) → 7 (nearby) → 13 (up) → 19 (right) → 2 (nearby) → 4 (top right) → 14 (down) → 18 (left) → 3 (right) → 8 (bottom right) → 17 (left) → 16 (left) → 12 (up-left) → 20 (left) → 9 (left) → 1 (up) → 6 (up) → 10 (right) → 15 (right) → 5 (down) → back to 11

Let me refine this by checking the path more carefully:

11 → 7 → 10 → 15 → 19 → 13 → 2 → 4 → 14 → 18 → 3 → 8 → 17 → 16 → 12 → 20 → 9 → 1 → 6 → 5 → 11

Actually, let me reconsider to create a smoother loop:

11 → 7 → 13 → 19 → 2 → 4 → 14 → 18 → 3 → 8 → 17 → 16 → 12 → 20 → 9 → 1 → 6 → 5 → 15 → 10 → 11

This creates a more circular path. Let me verify and optimize:

**Final answer:**

11, 7, 13, 19, 2, 4, 14, 18, 3, 8, 17, 16, 12, 20, 9, 1, 6, 5, 15, 10
