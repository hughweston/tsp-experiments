I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (68, 220)
2: (425, 165)
3: (285, 270)
4: (220, 350)
5: (730, 48)
6: (80, 135)
7: (200, 305)
8: (700, 280)
9: (255, 100)
10: (295, 205)
11: (18, 185)
12: (540, 265)
13: (305, 48)
14: (265, 165)
15: (365, 375)
16: (260, 205)
17: (660, 95)
18: (645, 255)
19: (530, 200)
20: (645, 295)
21: (640, 65)
22: (58, 105)
23: (305, 185)
24: (355, 325)
25: (330, 165)

Now I'll construct a tour using nearest neighbor heuristic and then try to optimize it.

Starting from point 1, let me trace a logical path by grouping nearby points:

Left side cluster: 11, 1, 6, 22
Top-middle: 9, 13, 14, 16, 10, 23, 25
Middle: 2, 3, 7, 4
Bottom: 15, 24
Right side: 19, 12, 18, 20, 8, 17, 21, 5

Let me construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from 11 (leftmost): 11 → 1 → 6 → 22 → 9 → 13 → 21 → 5 → 17 → 8 → 20 → 18 → 12 → 19 → 2 → 25 → 23 → 14 → 16 → 10 → 3 → 7 → 4 → 15 → 24 → back to 11

Let me try to optimize by considering a more circular path:

11 → 6 → 22 → 9 → 13 → 21 → 5 → 17 → 8 → 20 → 18 → 12 → 19 → 2 → 25 → 23 → 14 → 16 → 10 → 3 → 24 → 15 → 4 → 7 → 1 → 11

Refining further for a smoother loop:

22 → 6 → 11 → 1 → 7 → 4 → 15 → 24 → 3 → 10 → 16 → 14 → 9 → 13 → 25 → 23 → 2 → 19 → 12 → 18 → 20 → 8 → 17 → 21 → 5 → back to 22

Let me reconsider the path to make it flow better:

11, 1, 7, 4, 15, 24, 3, 10, 16, 14, 23, 25, 2, 19, 12, 20, 8, 18, 17, 21, 5, 13, 9, 22, 6

**Answer:**
11, 1, 7, 4, 15, 24, 3, 10, 16, 14, 9, 13, 25, 23, 2, 19, 12, 20, 8, 18, 17, 21, 5, 22, 6
