I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (168, 270)
2. (205, 355)
3. (70, 65)
4. (620, 340)
5. (710, 210)
6. (225, 230)
7. (680, 350)
8. (120, 380)
9. (590, 345)
10. (50, 395)
11. (400, 355)
12. (755, 100)
13. (305, 120)
14. (65, 245)
15. (290, 275)
16. (480, 45)
17. (75, 320)
18. (670, 390)
19. (530, 190)
20. (115, 140)
21. (345, 220)
22. (490, 270)
23. (195, 340)
24. (715, 265)
25. (225, 305)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by looking for nearest neighbors and trying to avoid crossing paths.

Starting from the leftmost points and working around:
- Cluster left: 10, 8, 17, 14, 20, 3
- Lower middle-left: 2, 23, 25, 1, 6, 15
- Upper middle: 13, 16, 12
- Right side: 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9
- Middle: 21, 19, 22, 11

Let me trace a logical tour avoiding crossings:

Starting at 3 (top left), going to nearby points:
3 → 20 → 14 → 17 → 10 → 8 → 2 → 23 → 25 → 1 → 6 → 15 → 21 → 13 → 16 → 12 → 5 → 24 → 7 → 18 → 4 → 9 → 11 → 22 → 19 → back to 3

Let me reconsider for a smoother path:

3 → 20 → 14 → 17 → 10 → 8 → 2 → 23 → 25 → 1 → 6 → 13 → 16 → 12 → 5 → 24 → 7 → 18 → 4 → 9 → 11 → 22 → 19 → 21 → 15 → back to 3

Actually, let me trace more carefully:
3 → 13 → 16 → 12 → 5 → 24 → 7 → 18 → 4 → 9 → 11 → 22 → 19 → 21 → 15 → 6 → 1 → 25 → 23 → 2 → 8 → 10 → 17 → 14 → 20 → 3

Reordering starting from 1:
1, 6, 15, 21, 19, 22, 11, 9, 4, 18, 7, 24, 5, 12, 16, 13, 3, 20, 14, 17, 10, 8, 2, 23, 25

**1, 25, 23, 2, 8, 10, 17, 14, 20, 3, 13, 16, 12, 5, 24, 7, 18, 4, 9, 11, 22, 19, 21, 15, 6**
