I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1: (295, 135)
2: (47, 47)
3: (47, 410)
4: (560, 245)
5: (200, 330)
6: (750, 315)
7: (660, 175)
8: (72, 270)
9: (310, 330)
10: (540, 55)
11: (678, 95)
12: (215, 165)
13: (665, 295)
14: (435, 280)
15: (47, 355)
16: (665, 390)
17: (365, 410)
18: (750, 235)
19: (130, 405)
20: (600, 390)
21: (455, 155)
22: (62, 215)
23: (210, 415)
24: (255, 47)
25: (210, 200)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the positions and grouping nearby points.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left area: 2, 24
- Top right area: 10, 11
- Right side: 7, 18, 6, 13, 16, 20
- Left side: 22, 8, 15, 3, 19
- Center-left: 12, 25, 5, 23
- Center: 1, 21, 14, 9, 17
- Bottom: 17, 23, 19, 3

Let me construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from 2 (top left), going clockwise:
2 → 24 → 10 → 11 → 7 → 18 → 6 → 13 → 16 → 20 → 17 → 23 → 19 → 3 → 15 → 8 → 22 → 25 → 12 → 1 → 21 → 4 → 14 → 9 → 5 → back to 2

Let me verify and optimize:
2 → 24 → 10 → 11 → 7 → 21 → 1 → 12 → 25 → 22 → 8 → 15 → 3 → 19 → 23 → 5 → 9 → 17 → 14 → 4 → 13 → 18 → 6 → 16 → 20 → back to start

Refining further for a smoother path:
2 → 24 → 1 → 12 → 25 → 22 → 8 → 15 → 3 → 19 → 23 → 5 → 9 → 17 → 20 → 16 → 6 → 18 → 13 → 4 → 14 → 21 → 7 → 11 → 10 → back to 2

Let me reconsider:
2 → 24 → 10 → 11 → 7 → 18 → 6 → 16 → 20 → 13 → 4 → 14 → 21 → 1 → 12 → 25 → 22 → 8 → 15 → 3 → 19 → 23 → 17 → 9 → 5 → back to 2

**Answer:**
2, 24, 10, 11, 7, 18, 6, 16, 20, 17, 23, 19, 3, 15, 8, 22, 25, 5, 9, 14, 4, 13, 21, 1, 12
