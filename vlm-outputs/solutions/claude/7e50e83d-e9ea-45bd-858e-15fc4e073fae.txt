I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (70, 490)
- Point 2: (560, 160)
- Point 3: (270, 165)
- Point 4: (540, 95)
- Point 5: (620, 320)
- Point 6: (750, 65)
- Point 7: (480, 220)
- Point 8: (350, 390)
- Point 9: (200, 245)
- Point 10: (95, 105)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all points. Let me analyze the positions and find a logical path that minimizes backtracking.

Looking at the layout:
- Point 10 is in the upper left
- Point 1 is in the lower left
- Points 3, 9 are in the left-center area
- Points 4, 6 are in the upper right
- Point 2, 7 are in the center-right
- Point 5 is in the right side
- Point 8 is in the center-bottom

Let me try to find a tour that follows a logical geographic pattern:

Starting from point 1 (lower left), I'll try to make a loop:
1 → 8 → 5 → 6 → 4 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 10 → 1

Let me also consider:
1 → 9 → 10 → 3 → 7 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 5 → 8 → 1

Checking another route that seems to follow the perimeter and inner points efficiently:
1 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 3 → 7 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 5 → 1

Let me trace a more optimal path:
- From 1 (lower left) → 8 (center bottom)
- 8 → 5 (right side)
- 5 → 6 (upper right)
- 6 → 4 (nearby upper right)
- 4 → 2 (nearby)
- 2 → 7 (nearby center)
- 7 → 3 (left center)
- 3 → 10 (upper left)
- 10 → 9 (nearby)
- 9 → 1 (back to start)

This gives: 1, 8, 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, 3, 10, 9

Let me verify this makes a good loop without too much crossing.

**1, 8, 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, 3, 10, 9**
