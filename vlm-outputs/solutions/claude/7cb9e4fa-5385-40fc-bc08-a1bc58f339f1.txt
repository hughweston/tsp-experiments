I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (168, 248)
- Point 2: (218, 378)
- Point 3: (118, 218)
- Point 4: (428, 288)
- Point 5: (178, 48)
- Point 6: (268, 48)
- Point 7: (58, 338)
- Point 8: (658, 368)
- Point 9: (698, 158)
- Point 10: (38, 368)
- Point 11: (38, 238)
- Point 12: (738, 168)
- Point 13: (628, 408)
- Point 14: (158, 108)
- Point 15: (688, 438)

Let me identify clusters and find a good route:
- Left cluster: 10, 7, 11, 3, 1, 14, 5, 6, 2
- Right cluster: 4, 9, 12, 8, 13, 15

I'll try to find a tour that minimizes backtracking by visiting nearby points in sequence.

Starting from point 10 and working around:
- 10 → 7 (nearby, bottom left)
- 7 → 11 (up slightly)
- 11 → 3 (nearby)
- 3 → 1 (nearby)
- 1 → 14 (up)
- 14 → 5 (up)
- 5 → 6 (right, top)
- 6 → 9 (far right upper area)
- 9 → 12 (nearby)
- 12 → 8 (down)
- 8 → 13 (nearby)
- 13 → 15 (nearby)
- 15 → 4 (back toward center)
- 4 → 2 (left)
- 2 → 10 (back to start)

Let me verify this makes sense by checking another route:
10 → 7 → 11 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 14 → 5 → 6 → 4 → 9 → 12 → 8 → 13 → 15

Actually, let me reconsider the connections more carefully:
- From 2, going to 4 makes sense
- Then 4 → 9 → 12 → 8 → 13 → 15 for the right side
- Need to close the loop back

Better route:
10 → 7 → 11 → 3 → 14 → 5 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 9 → 12 → 8 → 13 → 15 → back to 10

Wait, let me reconsider: 15 is far from 10. 

Optimized tour:
5 → 6 → 14 → 3 → 11 → 10 → 7 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 13 → 15 → 8 → 12 → 9

Let me try: 5, 14, 6, 9, 12, 8, 15, 13, 4, 2, 1, 3, 11, 10, 7

**5, 6, 9, 12, 8, 15, 13, 4, 2, 1, 3, 11, 10, 7, 14**
