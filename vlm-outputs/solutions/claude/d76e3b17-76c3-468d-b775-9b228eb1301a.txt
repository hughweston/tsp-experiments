I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (710, 120)
- Point 2: (670, 190)
- Point 3: (290, 390)
- Point 4: (200, 150)
- Point 5: (320, 470)
- Point 6: (225, 350)
- Point 7: (620, 175)
- Point 8: (95, 50)
- Point 9: (600, 110)
- Point 10: (570, 280)
- Point 11: (730, 45)
- Point 12: (670, 345)
- Point 13: (600, 215)
- Point 14: (270, 105)
- Point 15: (70, 130)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the positions and trying to create a route that doesn't cross itself.

Looking at the layout, I can identify clusters:
- Left side: 8, 15, 4, 14, 6, 3, 5
- Right side: 11, 1, 9, 7, 2, 13, 10, 12

Let me trace a logical path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 8 (top left), I'll try to make a smooth loop:
- 8 → 15 (nearby, left side)
- 15 → 4 (moving right and down slightly)
- 4 → 14 (close neighbor)
- 14 → 9 (moving to right cluster)
- 9 → 11 (top right)
- 11 → 1 (nearby)
- 1 → 2 (below)
- 2 → 7 (nearby)
- 7 → 13 (close)
- 13 → 10 (below)
- 10 → 12 (right and down)
- 12 → 5 (down and left)
- 5 → 3 (up and left)
- 3 → 6 (nearby)
- 6 → back to 8

Let me verify this makes a reasonable loop without too much crossing.

Trying another approach - creating a more circular path:
8 → 15 → 4 → 6 → 3 → 5 → 12 → 10 → 13 → 2 → 7 → 1 → 11 → 9 → 14 → 8

This seems to create a smoother outer loop.

Let me refine:
8 → 14 → 4 → 15 → 6 → 3 → 5 → 12 → 10 → 13 → 2 → 7 → 1 → 11 → 9 → 8

Actually, checking positions more carefully for a clean tour:
8 (top left) → 15 (left) → 6 (lower left) → 3 (center-left low) → 5 (bottom) → 12 (right low) → 10 (center right) → 13 → 2 → 7 → 1 → 11 (top right) → 9 → 14 → 4 → back to 8

**8, 15, 6, 3, 5, 12, 10, 13, 2, 7, 1, 11, 9, 14, 4**
