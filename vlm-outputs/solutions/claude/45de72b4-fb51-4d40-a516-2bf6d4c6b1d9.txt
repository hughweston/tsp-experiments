I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1. Point 1: (458, 248)
2. Point 2: (270, 190)
3. Point 3: (620, 310)
4. Point 4: (115, 310)
5. Point 5: (520, 410)
6. Point 6: (680, 95)
7. Point 7: (295, 65)
8. Point 8: (583, 90)
9. Point 9: (648, 85)
10. Point 10: (635, 120)
11. Point 11: (210, 305)
12. Point 12: (48, 370)
13. Point 13: (448, 378)
14. Point 14: (378, 115)
15. Point 15: (570, 245)
16. Point 16: (670, 155)
17. Point 17: (195, 250)
18. Point 18: (120, 205)
19. Point 19: (400, 310)
20. Point 20: (400, 100)

Now I need to find a short tour. Let me try to identify clusters and create a logical path:

Starting from the leftmost points and working around:
- Bottom left area: 12, 4, 11
- Upper left: 18, 17, 2
- Top center: 7, 20, 14
- Top right: 8, 9, 6, 10, 16
- Right side: 15, 3
- Center-bottom: 5, 13, 19, 1

Let me trace a tour that minimizes backtracking:

12 → 4 → 11 → 17 → 18 → 2 → 7 → 20 → 14 → 8 → 9 → 6 → 10 → 16 → 15 → 3 → 5 → 13 → 19 → 1 → back to 12

Let me reconsider for a better path:

12 → 4 → 11 → 17 → 18 → 2 → 7 → 20 → 14 → 8 → 9 → 6 → 10 → 16 → 15 → 3 → 5 → 13 → 19 → 1

Actually, let me optimize by checking the right side cluster more carefully:
6, 9, 8 are close together at top right, then 10, 16 below them, then 15, 3 lower.

Refined tour:
12 → 4 → 11 → 17 → 18 → 2 → 7 → 20 → 14 → 8 → 9 → 6 → 10 → 16 → 15 → 3 → 5 → 13 → 19 → 1

Checking if 1 connects well back to 12 - it's a long distance. Let me see if there's a better arrangement.

Alternative: End near center and have 1 connect through the middle:
12 → 4 → 11 → 17 → 18 → 2 → 7 → 20 → 14 → 1 → 19 → 13 → 5 → 3 → 15 → 16 → 10 → 6 → 9 → 8

This doesn't loop well back to 12.

Best tour:
12, 4, 11, 17, 18, 2, 7, 20, 14, 8, 9, 6, 10, 16, 15, 3, 5, 13, 19, 1
