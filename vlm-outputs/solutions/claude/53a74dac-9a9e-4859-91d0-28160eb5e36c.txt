I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (205, 130)
2. (480, 470)
3. (160, 465)
4. (370, 355)
5. (270, 455)
6. (180, 215)
7. (280, 210)
8. (640, 155)
9. (390, 135)
10. (25, 385)
11. (230, 350)
12. (720, 50)
13. (105, 420)
14. (600, 175)
15. (50, 75)
16. (500, 95)
17. (570, 375)
18. (620, 50)
19. (290, 350)
20. (155, 410)
21. (300, 125)
22. (680, 245)
23. (175, 105)
24. (100, 160)
25. (475, 45)

Now I'll find a short tour by considering geographical clusters and nearest neighbor approaches:

Starting from the top and working around:
- Top left cluster: 15, 23, 24
- Upper middle: 1, 21, 9, 25, 16
- Top right: 18, 12, 8, 14, 22
- Right side going down: 17, 2
- Bottom area: 5, 3, 13, 20, 10
- Middle: 11, 19, 4, 6, 7

Let me trace a logical path:
15 → 23 → 24 → 6 → 7 → 1 → 21 → 9 → 16 → 25 → 18 → 12 → 8 → 14 → 22 → 17 → 2 → 5 → 4 → 19 → 11 → 20 → 3 → 13 → 10 → back to 15

Let me refine this by checking for crossing paths and improvements:

15 → 23 → 1 → 21 → 9 → 16 → 25 → 18 → 12 → 8 → 14 → 22 → 17 → 2 → 5 → 4 → 19 → 11 → 20 → 3 → 13 → 10 → 24 → 6 → 7 → back to 15

Actually, let me reconsider the path more carefully:

15 → 23 → 24 → 10 → 13 → 20 → 3 → 5 → 2 → 17 → 22 → 14 → 8 → 12 → 18 → 25 → 16 → 9 → 21 → 7 → 6 → 1 → 11 → 19 → 4 → back to 15

Refining further for a cleaner tour:

15, 23, 1, 21, 7, 6, 24, 10, 13, 20, 3, 5, 11, 19, 4, 2, 17, 22, 14, 8, 12, 18, 25, 16, 9

**Answer:**
15, 23, 1, 21, 9, 16, 25, 18, 12, 8, 14, 22, 17, 2, 4, 19, 11, 5, 3, 20, 13, 10, 24, 6, 7
