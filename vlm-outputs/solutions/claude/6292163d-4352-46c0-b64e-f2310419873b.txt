I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (540, 470)
2. (108, 48)
3. (540, 410)
4. (540, 270)
5. (400, 320)
6. (230, 190)
7. (425, 390)
8. (330, 250)
9. (500, 70)
10. (300, 440)
11. (720, 300)
12. (50, 440)
13. (640, 320)
14. (720, 240)
14. (720, 240)
15. (680, 380)
16. (100, 350)
17. (670, 270)
18. (200, 320)
19. (505, 220)
20. (145, 420)

Let me work out a tour by identifying clusters and connecting them efficiently:

Looking at the layout:
- Top left: 2
- Top right area: 9
- Left side: 12, 20, 16, 18
- Center-left: 6, 8
- Center: 5, 7, 10
- Center-right: 19, 4, 3, 1
- Right side: 14, 17, 11, 13, 15

Let me trace a logical path trying to minimize backtracking:

Starting from point 2 (top left), I'll work around:
2 → 6 → 8 → 18 → 16 → 12 → 20 → 10 → 7 → 5 → 3 → 1 → 15 → 13 → 11 → 17 → 14 → 4 → 19 → 9 → back to 2

Let me reconsider by looking at nearby connections more carefully:

A better route considering distances:
2 → 9 → 19 → 4 → 14 → 17 → 11 → 13 → 15 → 3 → 1 → 7 → 5 → 8 → 6 → 18 → 16 → 12 → 20 → 10 → back to 2

Let me optimize further:
2 → 6 → 8 → 19 → 9 → 4 → 14 → 17 → 11 → 13 → 15 → 3 → 1 → 7 → 5 → 10 → 20 → 12 → 16 → 18 → back to 2

After analyzing the positions more carefully:

**2, 9, 19, 4, 14, 17, 11, 13, 15, 3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 6, 18, 16, 12, 20, 10**
