I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (205, 100)
- Point 2: (310, 355)
- Point 3: (720, 410)
- Point 4: (200, 245)
- Point 5: (680, 425)
- Point 6: (150, 155)
- Point 7: (150, 290)
- Point 8: (430, 165)
- Point 9: (350, 70)
- Point 10: (245, 110)
- Point 11: (270, 60)
- Point 12: (600, 30)
- Point 13: (25, 250)
- Point 14: (580, 340)
- Point 15: (460, 380)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by analyzing the positions and looking for a path that minimizes backtracking.

Looking at the layout:
- Left side: 13, 7, 6, 4, 1
- Upper middle: 11, 10, 9
- Upper right: 12
- Middle right: 8
- Lower middle: 2, 15
- Right side: 14, 5, 3

Let me try to construct a tour that follows a logical geographic path:

Starting from the leftmost point and working around:
13 → 7 → 4 → 6 → 1 → 10 → 11 → 9 → 12 → 8 → 14 → 3 → 5 → 15 → 2 → back to 13

Let me verify this makes sense geographically:
- 13 (far left) → 7 (nearby, below) → 4 (right of 7) → 6 (up from 4) → 1 (right of 6) → 10 (near 1) → 11 (above 10) → 9 (right of 11) → 12 (far right top) → 8 (below 12, left) → 14 (down right) → 3 (right bottom) → 5 (near 3) → 15 (left of 5) → 2 (left of 15) → back to 13

Let me check an alternative path to ensure this is efficient:
13 → 7 → 6 → 1 → 10 → 11 → 9 → 8 → 12 → 14 → 3 → 5 → 15 → 2 → 4 → 13

Comparing the paths, the second might be better as 4 is closer to 2 and 13.

Final answer:

13, 7, 6, 1, 10, 11, 9, 8, 12, 14, 3, 5, 15, 2, 4
