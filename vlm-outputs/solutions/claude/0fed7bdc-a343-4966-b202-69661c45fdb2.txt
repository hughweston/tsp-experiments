I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (640, 350)
- Point 2: (735, 120)
- Point 3: (620, 70)
- Point 4: (410, 255)
- Point 5: (700, 130)
- Point 6: (480, 340)
- Point 7: (245, 75)
- Point 8: (530, 385)
- Point 9: (430, 335)
- Point 10: (50, 410)
- Point 11: (55, 190)
- Point 12: (150, 65)
- Point 13: (595, 245)
- Point 14: (220, 385)
- Point 15: (400, 45)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all these points. Let me try to identify clusters and create a logical path.

Looking at the layout:
- Top area: 12, 7, 15, 3, 2, 5
- Middle-left: 11, 10, 14
- Middle-right: 4, 13, 1
- Bottom-middle: 9, 6, 8

Let me try to construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 10 (bottom-left), I'll try to make a logical loop:
10 → 14 → 11 → 12 → 7 → 15 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 13 → 1 → 8 → 6 → 9 → 4 → back to 10

Let me verify this makes sense geometrically:
- 10 (bottom-left) → 14 (nearby) → 11 (up-left) → 12 (top-left) → 7 (nearby) → 15 (top-middle) → 3 (top-right) → 2 (far right) → 5 (near 2) → 13 (down) → 1 (right-middle) → 8 (down) → 6 (left of 8) → 9 (left of 6) → 4 (up from 9) → back to 10

This seems like a reasonable tour. Let me check if any improvements can be made by considering the connections more carefully.

Alternative path checking the right side: 5, 2, 3 are close together at top-right. Going 2→5→3 or 3→2→5 or 5→2→3...

Refined tour:
10 → 14 → 11 → 12 → 7 → 15 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 13 → 1 → 8 → 6 → 9 → 4 → 10

This creates a roughly circular path around the points.

**Answer:** 10, 14, 11, 12, 7, 15, 3, 2, 5, 1, 13, 4, 9, 6, 8
