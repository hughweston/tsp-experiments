I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (580, 410)
- Point 2: (205, 270)
- Point 3: (270, 500)
- Point 4: (30, 400)
- Point 5: (480, 170)
- Point 6: (240, 60)
- Point 7: (105, 385)
- Point 8: (580, 280)
- Point 9: (520, 95)
- Point 10: (60, 490)
- Point 11: (470, 420)
- Point 12: (400, 295)
- Point 13: (300, 410)
- Point 14: (580, 480)
- Point 15: (30, 370)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and nearest neighbor connections.

Looking at the layout:
- Left side: 4, 15, 7, 10
- Top area: 6, 9, 5
- Right side: 8, 1, 14
- Middle: 2, 12, 13, 11, 3

Let me trace a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from point 6 (top left area), going to nearby points:
6 → 9 (nearby, top right) → 5 (below 9) → 8 (right side) → 12 (middle) → 1 (right) → 14 (bottom right) → 11 (left of 14) → 13 (middle left) → 3 (below 13) → 10 (bottom left) → 4 (left side) → 15 (above 4) → 7 (near 15) → 2 (up and right) → back to 6

Let me verify this makes a logical geographic path:
6(240,60) → 9(520,95) → 5(480,170) → 8(580,280) → 12(400,295) → 1(580,410) → 14(580,480) → 11(470,420) → 13(300,410) → 3(270,500) → 10(60,490) → 4(30,400) → 15(30,370) → 7(105,385) → 2(205,270) → 6

Let me check another arrangement:
6 → 2 → 7 → 15 → 4 → 10 → 3 → 13 → 11 → 14 → 1 → 8 → 12 → 5 → 9 → 6

This follows a more logical loop pattern around the perimeter and through the middle.

Refining: 6 → 9 → 5 → 8 → 1 → 14 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 3 → 10 → 4 → 15 → 7 → 2 → 6

**Answer:** 6, 9, 5, 8, 1, 14, 11, 12, 13, 3, 10, 4, 15, 7, 2
