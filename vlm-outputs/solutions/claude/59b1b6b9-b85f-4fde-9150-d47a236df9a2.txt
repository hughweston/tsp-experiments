I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (350, 295)
- Point 2: (455, 135)
- Point 3: (230, 220)
- Point 4: (310, 65)
- Point 5: (305, 470)
- Point 6: (265, 290)
- Point 7: (175, 490)
- Point 8: (640, 18)
- Point 9: (570, 320)
- Point 10: (115, 165)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all points. Let me visualize the positions:
- Top right: 8
- Upper area: 4, 2
- Left side: 10, 3
- Middle: 6, 1
- Right middle: 9
- Bottom: 7, 5

Let me try to find a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical path:

Starting from point 10 (far left), I'll try to create a roughly circular tour:
- 10 → 3 (nearby, moving right and down slightly)
- 3 → 6 (close, moving down)
- 6 → 7 (moving to bottom left)
- 7 → 5 (moving right along bottom)
- 5 → 1 (moving up)
- 1 → 9 (moving right)
- 9 → 8 (moving up to top right)
- 8 → 2 (moving left and down)
- 2 → 4 (moving left)
- 4 → 10 (completing the loop)

Let me also consider another route:
10 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 9 → 1 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 3 → 10

Comparing the tours, let me trace a more efficient path:
- 10 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 9 → 1 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 10

Or trying to make a cleaner loop:
- 7 → 5 → 9 → 8 → 2 → 4 → 10 → 3 → 6 → 1 → 7

Let me reconsider the layout and find an efficient circular path:
Starting from 10, going: 10 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 9 → 1 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 3 → 10

This creates a reasonable loop through the points.

**Answer:** 10, 3, 6, 7, 5, 1, 9, 8, 2, 4
