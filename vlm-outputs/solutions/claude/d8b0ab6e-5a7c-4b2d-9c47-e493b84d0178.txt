I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 25 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (213, 340)
2. (180, 248)
3. (603, 320)
4. (430, 328)
5. (205, 47)
6. (95, 213)
7. (678, 368)
8. (168, 42)
9. (28, 305)
10. (448, 248)
11. (602, 400)
12. (350, 75)
13. (753, 433)
14. (648, 388)
15. (270, 175)
16. (570, 320)
17. (108, 68)
18. (365, 345)
19. (618, 178)
20. (185, 82)
21. (530, 248)
22. (540, 390)
23. (665, 318)
24. (115, 388)
25. (398, 418)

Let me find a good tour by identifying clusters and connecting them efficiently:

Top cluster: 17, 8, 5, 20, 12
Right side: 19, 21, 10, 16, 3, 23, 7, 14, 13, 11, 22
Middle-left: 6, 2, 15, 1, 18, 4, 25
Left edge: 9, 24

Let me trace a logical path:

Starting from 17 (top-left): 17 → 8 → 5 → 20 → 12 → 19 → 21 → 10 → 16 → 3 → 23 → 7 → 13 → 14 → 11 → 22 → 25 → 18 → 4 → 1 → 24 → 9 → 6 → 2 → 15 → back to 17

Let me refine this by checking nearby connections:

9 → 24 → 6 → 2 → 1 → 18 → 25 → 22 → 11 → 14 → 13 → 7 → 23 → 3 → 16 → 21 → 10 → 19 → 12 → 15 → 20 → 5 → 8 → 17 → 6... 

Let me try another approach:
17 → 8 → 5 → 20 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 6 → 9 → 24 → 1 → 18 → 25 → 22 → 11 → 14 → 13 → 7 → 23 → 3 → 16 → 21 → 10 → 4 → 19 → back

Refined tour:
9 → 24 → 1 → 18 → 25 → 22 → 11 → 13 → 7 → 14 → 23 → 3 → 16 → 21 → 19 → 10 → 4 → 12 → 15 → 20 → 5 → 8 → 17 → 6 → 2 → 9

**Final answer:**

9, 24, 1, 18, 25, 22, 11, 13, 7, 14, 23, 3, 16, 21, 19, 12, 10, 4, 15, 20, 5, 8, 17, 6, 2
