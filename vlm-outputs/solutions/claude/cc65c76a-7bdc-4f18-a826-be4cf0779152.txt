I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (565, 135)
- Point 2: (175, 390)
- Point 3: (25, 470)
- Point 4: (200, 435)
- Point 5: (270, 25)
- Point 6: (640, 280)
- Point 7: (480, 25)
- Point 8: (125, 440)
- Point 9: (320, 445)
- Point 10: (240, 80)

Now I need to find a short tour. Let me analyze the positions:
- Points 5, 10, 7 are in the upper region
- Point 1 is upper right
- Point 6 is right side, middle
- Points 3, 8, 2, 4, 9 are in the lower region

Let me try to find a tour that doesn't cross itself by following a logical path:

Starting from the bottom left and working around:
- Point 3 (far left, bottom)
- Point 8 (nearby, bottom)
- Point 2 (nearby, bottom)
- Point 4 (nearby, bottom)
- Point 9 (bottom, more right)
- Point 6 (right side)
- Point 1 (upper right)
- Point 7 (top, right of center)
- Point 5 (top, left of center)
- Point 10 (upper left area)
- Back to 3

Let me verify this makes a reasonable path without crossings:
3 → 8 → 2 → 4 → 9 → 6 → 1 → 7 → 5 → 10 → 3

This traces a roughly circular path around the points.

Let me check if connecting 1 to 7 and then to 5 is efficient, or if 1 → 5 → 7 would be better:
- Point 1 is at (565, 135), Point 7 at (480, 25), Point 5 at (270, 25)
- Going 1 → 7 → 5 follows a logical path along the top

Alternative: 3 → 8 → 2 → 4 → 9 → 6 → 1 → 7 → 5 → 10 → 3

This appears to be a good tour following the perimeter.

**Answer:** 3, 8, 2, 4, 9, 6, 1, 7, 5, 10
