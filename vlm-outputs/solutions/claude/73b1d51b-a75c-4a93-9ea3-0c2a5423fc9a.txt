I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (400, 270)
- Point 2: (390, 190)
- Point 3: (295, 250)
- Point 4: (640, 380)
- Point 5: (565, 450)
- Point 6: (720, 165)
- Point 7: (150, 340)
- Point 8: (480, 95)
- Point 9: (45, 420)
- Point 10: (205, 80)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all these points. Let me try to identify clusters and create a logical path.

Looking at the layout:
- Top area: 10, 8, 6
- Middle area: 2, 3, 1
- Left side: 7, 9
- Right/bottom area: 4, 5

Let me try to form a tour that minimizes backtracking by following a logical geographic path:

Starting from point 9 (bottom left), I'll try to make a smooth loop:
- 9 → 7 (nearby, going up-right)
- 7 → 10 (going up)
- 10 → 8 (going right along top)
- 8 → 6 (going right)
- 6 → 4 (going down right side)
- 4 → 5 (nearby)
- 5 → 1 (going up-left)
- 1 → 2 (going up)
- 2 → 3 (going left)
- 3 → 9 (back to start)

Let me check another route:
9 → 7 → 3 → 10 → 8 → 2 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 5 → 9

Or trying a more circular path:
9 → 7 → 10 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 9

Let me reconsider by looking at nearest neighbors and forming a clean loop:
- 9 (far left bottom) → 7 → 3 → 10 → 8 → 2 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 5 → back to 9

Comparing distances, a good tour appears to be:
9 → 7 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 10 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 5 → 9

Or going the other direction around the middle:
9 → 7 → 10 → 8 → 2 → 6 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 9

Let me settle on a clean loop:
**9, 7, 3, 10, 8, 2, 1, 6, 4, 5**

This creates a reasonable path from bottom-left, up through the middle-left, across the top, down the right side, and back.
