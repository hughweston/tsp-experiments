I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (108, 190)
- Point 2: (28, 195)
- Point 3: (628, 68)
- Point 4: (658, 468)
- Point 5: (480, 118)
- Point 6: (168, 190)
- Point 7: (530, 170)
- Point 8: (48, 108)
- Point 9: (708, 248)
- Point 10: (418, 318)
- Point 11: (148, 48)
- Point 12: (688, 98)
- Point 13: (388, 368)
- Point 14: (698, 168)
- Point 15: (478, 368)

Now I need to find a short tour. Let me identify clusters and try to create a logical path:

Left cluster: 2, 1, 6, 8, 11
Right upper cluster: 3, 12, 14, 9, 5, 7
Middle/lower cluster: 10, 13, 15, 4

Let me try to construct a tour that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from the left side and working around:
- 2 → 1 → 6 (left bottom group)
- 6 → 8 → 11 (up to top left)
- 11 → 5 (across to middle top)
- 5 → 7 → 3 → 12 → 14 → 9 (right side, top to bottom)
- 9 → 4 (down right)
- 4 → 15 → 13 → 10 (middle lower area back left)
- 10 → back to 2

Let me verify this tour: 2 → 1 → 6 → 8 → 11 → 5 → 3 → 12 → 14 → 9 → 4 → 15 → 13 → 10 → 7 → back to 2

Wait, I need to reconsider to include point 7 properly.

Let me try: 2 → 1 → 6 → 8 → 11 → 5 → 7 → 3 → 12 → 14 → 9 → 4 → 15 → 13 → 10 → 2

Checking the path makes geographical sense:
- Start at 2 (far left)
- Go to nearby 1, then 6
- Up to 8, then 11 (top left)
- Across to 5 (middle top)
- To 7 (nearby)
- To 3, 12, 14, 9 (right side going down)
- Down to 4 (bottom right)
- Left to 15, 13, 10 (middle bottom)
- Back to 2

This creates a reasonable loop without too much crossing.

**Answer:** 2, 1, 6, 8, 11, 5, 7, 3, 12, 14, 9, 4, 15, 13, 10
