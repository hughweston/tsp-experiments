I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Point 1: (465, 213)
- Point 2: (213, 268)
- Point 3: (168, 318)
- Point 4: (363, 107)
- Point 5: (68, 93)
- Point 6: (93, 163)
- Point 7: (318, 358)
- Point 8: (628, 448)
- Point 9: (678, 443)
- Point 10: (298, 58)
- Point 11: (148, 328)
- Point 12: (28, 353)
- Point 13: (448, 218)
- Point 14: (628, 258)
- Point 15: (303, 113)
- Point 16: (468, 153)
- Point 17: (413, 268)
- Point 18: (168, 98)
- Point 19: (58, 383)
- Point 20: (218, 403)

Let me construct a tour by analyzing geographic clusters and finding a path that minimizes backtracking:

Starting from the top and working around:
- Top cluster: 10, 4, 15, 18, 5, 6
- Left side: 12, 19, 11, 3, 2, 20, 7
- Right side: 17, 13, 1, 16, 14, 9, 8

Let me trace a logical tour:
Starting at 10 (top center) → 4 → 16 → 14 → 9 → 8 → 7 → 20 → 19 → 12 → 11 → 3 → 2 → 6 → 5 → 18 → 15 → 10... wait, need to include all points.

Let me try again more carefully:
10 → 15 → 4 → 16 → 1 → 13 → 17 → 14 → 9 → 8 → 7 → 20 → 19 → 12 → 11 → 3 → 2 → 6 → 5 → 18 → back to 10

Checking this covers all 20 points: 10, 15, 4, 16, 1, 13, 17, 14, 9, 8, 7, 20, 19, 12, 11, 3, 2, 6, 5, 18 ✓

Let me verify this makes geographic sense and try to optimize:

5 → 18 → 10 → 15 → 4 → 16 → 14 → 9 → 8 → 7 → 20 → 19 → 12 → 11 → 3 → 2 → 17 → 13 → 1 → 6

Actually, let me reconsider for a better path:
5 → 6 → 18 → 10 → 15 → 4 → 16 → 1 → 13 → 17 → 14 → 9 → 8 → 7 → 20 → 19 → 12 → 11 → 3 → 2 → back to 5

This forms a more logical loop.

**Answer:**
5, 6, 18, 10, 15, 4, 16, 1, 13, 14, 9, 8, 7, 20, 19, 12, 11, 3, 2, 17
