I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Point 1: (595, 460)
- Point 2: (425, 390)
- Point 3: (330, 295)
- Point 4: (350, 390)
- Point 5: (205, 245)
- Point 6: (350, 50)
- Point 7: (100, 460)
- Point 8: (520, 270)
- Point 9: (640, 245)
- Point 10: (450, 325)
- Point 11: (100, 135)
- Point 12: (320, 100)
- Point 13: (330, 330)
- Point 14: (420, 420)
- Point 15: (240, 95)

Now I'll try to find a short tour by connecting nearby points and avoiding crossing paths.

Looking at the layout, I'll try to trace an efficient path:

Starting from the outer points and working around:
- Point 7 (bottom left) → Point 11 (upper left) → Point 15 (top) → Point 6 (top) → Point 12 (near top) → Point 5 (left middle) → Point 3 (middle) → Point 13 (middle) → Point 4 (middle left) → Point 2 (middle) → Point 14 (lower middle) → Point 1 (bottom right) → Point 9 (right) → Point 8 (right middle) → Point 10 (middle)

Let me reconsider for a more logical path:

Following a roughly circular tour:
7 → 11 → 15 → 6 → 12 → 5 → 3 → 13 → 4 → 14 → 2 → 10 → 8 → 9 → 1 → back to 7

Let me try another approach, tracing the perimeter and inner points:
- 7 (bottom left) → 11 (left) → 15 → 6 → 12 → 9 (far right) → 8 → 1 (bottom right) → 14 → 2 → 10 → 13 → 3 → 4 → 5 → back to 7

Checking a cleaner path:
7 → 11 → 5 → 15 → 6 → 12 → 3 → 13 → 4 → 2 → 14 → 1 → 9 → 8 → 10

This creates a reasonable tour without too many crossings.

**Answer:** 7, 11, 5, 15, 6, 12, 3, 13, 4, 2, 14, 1, 9, 8, 10
