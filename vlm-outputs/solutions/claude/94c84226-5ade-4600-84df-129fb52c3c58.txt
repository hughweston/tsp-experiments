I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Point 1: (595, 160)
- Point 2: (680, 340)
- Point 3: (300, 65)
- Point 4: (430, 55)
- Point 5: (255, 60)
- Point 6: (70, 295)
- Point 7: (655, 320)
- Point 8: (310, 345)
- Point 9: (105, 330)
- Point 10: (545, 230)
- Point 11: (500, 185)
- Point 12: (185, 260)
- Point 13: (225, 195)
- Point 14: (115, 405)
- Point 15: (710, 375)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by looking for a path that doesn't cross itself and connects nearby points.

Looking at the layout, the points seem to form a rough pattern. Let me trace a logical tour:

Starting from the top and working around:
- Points 5, 3, 4 are at the top
- Point 1, 11, 10 are in the upper right area
- Points 7, 2, 15 are on the right side
- Points 8, 14, 9, 6 are on the left/bottom left
- Points 12, 13 are in the middle left

Let me try a tour that forms a reasonable loop:

Starting at 5 (top left area):
5 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 11 → 10 → 7 → 2 → 15 → 8 → 14 → 9 → 6 → 12 → 13 → back to 5

Wait, let me reconsider the positions and find a better path:

Going clockwise from top:
5 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 11 → 10 → 7 → 2 → 15 → 14 → 9 → 6 → 12 → 13 → 8 → back to 5

Let me reconsider point 8's position - it's in the middle-bottom area.

A better tour:
5 → 3 → 4 → 11 → 1 → 10 → 7 → 2 → 15 → 8 → 14 → 9 → 6 → 12 → 13 → 5

Checking another arrangement:
6 → 9 → 14 → 8 → 15 → 2 → 7 → 10 → 1 → 11 → 4 → 3 → 5 → 13 → 12 → 6

This creates a smooth loop around the perimeter.

**Final Answer:**
6, 9, 14, 8, 15, 2, 7, 10, 1, 11, 4, 3, 5, 13, 12
