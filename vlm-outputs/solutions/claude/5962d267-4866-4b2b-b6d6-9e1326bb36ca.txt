I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point:
- Point 1: (175, 295)
- Point 2: (150, 190)
- Point 3: (250, 430)
- Point 4: (245, 295)
- Point 5: (310, 190)
- Point 6: (640, 370)
- Point 7: (280, 95)
- Point 8: (480, 75)
- Point 9: (680, 295)
- Point 10: (50, 320)
- Point 11: (545, 135)
- Point 12: (155, 395)
- Point 13: (115, 215)
- Point 14: (620, 80)
- Point 15: (280, 55)

Now I'll try to find a short tour by connecting nearby points and avoiding crossing paths.

Looking at the layout, I can identify clusters:
- Left side: 10, 13, 2, 1, 12
- Middle-left: 4, 5, 7, 15
- Bottom: 3
- Right side: 8, 11, 14, 9, 6

Let me trace a tour that moves efficiently through these regions:

Starting from point 10 (far left), I'll try to make a logical loop:
- 10 → 13 → 2 (going up the left side)
- 2 → 7 → 15 (moving to upper middle)
- 15 → 8 → 14 → 11 (across the top right)
- 11 → 9 → 6 (down the right side)
- 6 → 3 (going to bottom middle)
- 3 → 12 → 1 → 4 → 5 (back through middle)
- Wait, let me reconsider...

Let me try a more systematic approach:
- 10 → 13 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 15 → 8 → 14 → 11 → 9 → 6 → 3 → 12 → back to 10

Checking another route:
- 10 → 12 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 11 → 14 → 8 → 15 → 7 → 5 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 13 → 10

Let me optimize by avoiding long jumps:
- 10 → 13 → 2 → 7 → 15 → 5 → 4 → 1 → 12 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 11 → 14 → 8 → back to 10

Actually, connecting 8 back to 10 is long. Let me try:
- 10 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 15 → 8 → 14 → 11 → 9 → 6 → 3 → 12 → 13 → 2 → 10

This creates a smoother loop.

Final answer:
**10, 13, 2, 7, 15, 8, 14, 11, 9, 6, 3, 12, 1, 4, 5**
