I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. Point 1: (480, 165)
2. Point 2: (270, 390)
3. Point 3: (50, 135)
4. Point 4: (620, 310)
5. Point 5: (230, 50)
6. Point 6: (540, 330)
7. Point 7: (640, 45)
8. Point 8: (400, 75)
9. Point 9: (720, 320)
10. Point 10: (700, 245)
11. Point 11: (400, 140)
12. Point 12: (115, 335)
13. Point 13: (70, 400)
14. Point 14: (560, 110)
15. Point 15: (140, 105)
16. Point 16: (365, 385)
17. Point 17: (55, 75)
18. Point 18: (520, 305)
19. Point 19: (340, 90)
20. Point 20: (320, 395)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and trying to avoid crossing paths.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left cluster: 17, 3, 15, 5
- Top middle/right: 19, 8, 11, 1, 14, 7
- Right side: 10, 9, 4
- Bottom middle: 18, 6
- Bottom left: 12, 13, 20, 2, 16

Let me construct a tour that moves efficiently:

Starting from 17 (top left), going clockwise:
17 → 3 → 15 → 5 → 19 → 8 → 11 → 1 → 14 → 7 → 10 → 9 → 4 → 18 → 6 → 16 → 20 → 2 → 12 → 13 → back to 17

Let me verify this makes geographical sense and try to optimize:

A better route considering positions:
17 → 5 → 19 → 8 → 11 → 1 → 14 → 7 → 10 → 9 → 4 → 18 → 6 → 16 → 20 → 2 → 12 → 13 → 3 → 15 → 17

Actually, let me reconsider the left side: 17, 15, 3 are close together, and 13, 12 are below them.

Optimized tour:
13 → 12 → 2 → 20 → 16 → 6 → 18 → 4 → 9 → 10 → 7 → 14 → 1 → 11 → 8 → 19 → 5 → 15 → 17 → 3 → 13

**Answer:**
13, 3, 17, 15, 5, 19, 8, 11, 1, 14, 7, 10, 9, 4, 18, 6, 16, 20, 2, 12
