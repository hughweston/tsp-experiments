I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (205, 90)
- Point 2: (330, 105)
- Point 3: (270, 50)
- Point 4: (230, 400)
- Point 5: (595, 500)
- Point 6: (15, 430)
- Point 7: (175, 30)
- Point 8: (75, 175)
- Point 9: (340, 285)
- Point 10: (580, 330)

Now I'll try to find a short tour by looking for a logical path that minimizes backtracking.

Let me identify clusters and nearby points:
- Top area: 7, 1, 3, 2
- Left side: 8, 6
- Middle-right: 9, 10
- Bottom: 4, 5

Starting from point 7, I'll try to create a tour that moves efficiently:

Option 1: Following a roughly circular path
7 → 3 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 6 → 8 → 1 → 7

Let me trace this visually:
- 7 (top left) → 3 (top middle) → 2 (top right of cluster) → 9 (center) → 10 (right) → 5 (bottom right) → 4 (bottom center-left) → 6 (bottom left) → 8 (left) → 1 (top) → back to 7

Let me consider another route:
7 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 6 → 8 → 7

Checking the flow:
- 7 to 1: short distance (nearby)
- 1 to 3: short
- 3 to 2: short
- 2 to 9: moderate
- 9 to 10: moderate
- 10 to 5: moderate
- 5 to 4: long diagonal
- 4 to 6: moderate
- 6 to 8: moderate
- 8 to 7: moderate

Let me try: 7 → 1 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 5 → 10 → 9 → 2 → 3 → 7

This creates a loop going left side down, then right side up.

Comparing routes, the second option seems to create a cleaner loop without crossing paths.

My answer: **7, 3, 2, 9, 10, 5, 4, 6, 8, 1**
