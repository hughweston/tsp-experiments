I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (155, 295)
- Point 2: (645, 290)
- Point 3: (540, 390)
- Point 4: (330, 75)
- Point 5: (350, 390)
- Point 6: (570, 195)
- Point 7: (700, 70)
- Point 8: (480, 320)
- Point 9: (75, 280)
- Point 10: (455, 160)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering the spatial layout:

Looking at the positions:
- Left side: 9, 1
- Bottom middle: 5, 8, 3
- Top middle: 4, 10
- Right side: 6, 7, 2

Let me try to construct a tour that doesn't have crossing paths:

Starting from point 9 (leftmost), I'll try to make a logical loop:
- 9 → 1 (nearby on left)
- 1 → 5 (down and right)
- 5 → 3 (right along bottom)
- 3 → 2 (up to right side)
- 2 → 7 (up along right)
- 7 → 6 (down and left)
- 6 → 10 (left)
- 10 → 4 (left and up)
- 4 → 8 (down to middle)
- 8 → back to 9

Wait, let me reconsider to avoid crossings:

Try: 9 → 1 → 5 → 8 → 3 → 2 → 7 → 6 → 10 → 4 → 9

Let me check another route:
9 → 1 → 4 → 10 → 6 → 7 → 2 → 3 → 8 → 5 → 9

Or going around more efficiently:
9 → 1 → 5 → 8 → 3 → 2 → 6 → 7 → 10 → 4 → 9

Let me trace a clean outer loop plus inner points:
- 9 (far left) → 4 (top middle) → 7 (top right) → 2 (right) → 3 (bottom right) → 5 (bottom middle) → 1 (left) → back to 9
- Need to insert: 6, 8, 10

Better tour: 9 → 1 → 5 → 8 → 3 → 2 → 7 → 6 → 10 → 4 → 9

This creates a reasonable loop visiting all points.

**Answer:** 9, 1, 5, 8, 3, 2, 7, 6, 10, 4
