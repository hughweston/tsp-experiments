I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 30 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (723, 127)
2. (621, 206)
3. (217, 491)
4. (197, 157)
5. (453, 181)
6. (95, 471)
7. (391, 267)
8. (273, 371)
9. (673, 206)
10. (430, 431)
11. (640, 286)
12. (620, 411)
13. (468, 107)
14. (453, 251)
15. (390, 371)
16. (400, 316)
17. (667, 381)
18. (328, 37)
19. (145, 361)
20. (573, 301)
21. (723, 321)
22. (507, 461)
23. (363, 267)
24. (213, 77)
25. (473, 341)
26. (507, 301)
27. (620, 261)
28. (573, 381)
29. (723, 57)
30. (63, 251)

Now I need to find a short tour. I'll use a nearest neighbor heuristic and then try to improve it by looking for a logical geographic path.

Looking at the layout, I'll try to create a tour that follows the outer boundary and then handles interior points efficiently:

Starting from the top and going around:
- Top right area: 29, 1, 9, 21
- Right side down: 17, 12, 28, 22
- Bottom: 10, 3, 6
- Left side up: 30, 19, 8
- Back through middle: 15, 16, 23, 7
- Upper left: 4, 24, 18, 13
- Middle right: 5, 14, 26, 25, 20, 27, 11, 2

Let me trace a more coherent path:

Starting at 29 (top right): 29 → 1 → 9 → 2 → 27 → 11 → 21 → 17 → 12 → 28 → 22 → 10 → 3 → 6 → 30 → 19 → 8 → 15 → 16 → 23 → 7 → 14 → 5 → 13 → 18 → 24 → 4 → 25 → 26 → 20 → back to 29

Let me reconsider for a better path:

18 → 24 → 4 → 30 → 19 → 6 → 3 → 8 → 15 → 10 → 22 → 12 → 28 → 17 → 21 → 9 → 1 → 29 → 2 → 27 → 11 → 20 → 26 → 25 → 16 → 23 → 7 → 14 → 5 → 13 → 18

Refined tour:

18, 24, 4, 30, 19, 6, 3, 8, 15, 10, 22, 12, 28, 17, 21, 9, 1, 29, 2, 27, 11, 20, 26, 25, 16, 23, 7, 14, 5, 13
