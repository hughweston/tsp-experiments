I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (168, 400)
- Point 2: (48, 435)
- Point 3: (588, 445)
- Point 4: (678, 355)
- Point 5: (588, 390)
- Point 6: (152, 68)
- Point 7: (68, 100)
- Point 8: (480, 365)
- Point 9: (560, 248)
- Point 10: (748, 395)

Now I need to find a short tour. Let me analyze the layout:
- Points 6, 7 are in the upper left
- Points 1, 2 are in the lower left
- Points 8, 9 are in the middle
- Points 3, 4, 5, 10 are on the right side

Let me try to construct a tour that doesn't have crossing paths:

Starting from the upper left and working around:
- 7 → 6 (nearby, upper left)
- 6 → 9 (moving right across the middle-upper area)
- 9 → 4 (moving to upper right)
- 4 → 10 (right side)
- 10 → 3 (down on right side)
- 3 → 5 (nearby)
- 5 → 8 (moving left)
- 8 → 1 (continuing left)
- 1 → 2 (lower left)
- 2 → 7 (back up to start)

Let me verify this makes sense geographically and check for a better route.

Alternative route checking:
7 → 6 → 1 → 2 → ... but 1 and 2 are far from 6.

Better to keep upper left together and lower left together:
2 → 1 → 7 → 6 → 9 → 4 → 10 → 3 → 5 → 8 → back to 2

Let me check: 2 → 7 → 6 → 1 might cross paths.

Optimal looking tour:
7 → 6 → 9 → 4 → 10 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 1 → 2 → 7

This creates a roughly circular path without major crossings.

**Answer:** 7, 6, 9, 4, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1, 2
