I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (310, 290)
- Point 2: (735, 490)
- Point 3: (135, 390)
- Point 4: (390, 95)
- Point 5: (330, 150)
- Point 6: (45, 410)
- Point 7: (215, 490)
- Point 8: (680, 50)
- Point 9: (125, 420)
- Point 10: (570, 490)
- Point 11: (385, 130)
- Point 12: (205, 75)
- Point 13: (555, 350)
- Point 14: (520, 80)
- Point 15: (165, 250)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all these points. Let me identify clusters and try to create a logical path:

Looking at the layout:
- Top region: 12, 4, 11, 5, 14, 8
- Middle-left: 15, 3, 6, 9
- Middle-right: 1, 13
- Bottom: 7, 10, 2

Let me try to construct a tour that doesn't cross itself:

Starting from point 6 (leftmost), going around:
6 → 9 → 3 → 15 → 12 → 5 → 11 → 4 → 14 → 8 → 2 → 10 → 13 → 1 → 7

Let me verify this makes a reasonable path:
- 6(45,410) → 9(125,420) → 3(135,390) → 15(165,250) → 12(205,75) → 5(330,150) → 11(385,130) → 4(390,95) → 14(520,80) → 8(680,50) → 2(735,490) → 10(570,490) → 13(555,350) → 1(310,290) → 7(215,490) → back to 6

This seems to make a reasonable loop. Let me check if there's a better connection for point 7:
7 is at bottom-left area, so connecting 1 → 7 → 6 makes sense.

Reviewing the tour for crossings and optimizing:
6 → 9 → 3 → 7 → 10 → 2 → 8 → 14 → 4 → 11 → 5 → 12 → 15 → 1 → 13 → back to 6

Actually, let me reconsider:
12 → 5 → 11 → 4 → 14 → 8 (top path left to right)
Then 8 → 2 → 10 → 13 → 1 (right side down and back)
Then 1 → 7 → 9 → 6 → 3 → 15 → 12 (bottom and left side)

Final tour:
12, 5, 11, 4, 14, 8, 2, 10, 13, 1, 7, 9, 6, 3, 15

**12, 5, 11, 4, 14, 8, 2, 10, 13, 1, 7, 9, 6, 3, 15**
