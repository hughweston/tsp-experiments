I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (680, 350)
- Point 2: (175, 195)
- Point 3: (615, 45)
- Point 4: (250, 330)
- Point 5: (365, 50)
- Point 6: (570, 355)
- Point 7: (45, 100)
- Point 8: (570, 130)
- Point 9: (480, 130)
- Point 10: (245, 135)
- Point 11: (480, 270)
- Point 12: (620, 225)
- Point 13: (365, 125)
- Point 14: (450, 390)
- Point 15: (735, 120)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and trying to avoid crossing paths.

Looking at the layout:
- Left side: 7, 2, 10, 4
- Top middle: 5, 13, 9
- Top right: 3, 8, 15
- Right side: 12, 1
- Bottom middle: 6, 14, 11

Let me try to construct a tour that moves efficiently through these clusters:

Starting from point 7 (far left), moving through nearby points:
7 → 2 → 10 → 13 → 5 → 3 → 8 → 15 → 12 → 1 → 6 → 14 → 11 → 9 → 4 → back to 7

Let me reconsider by tracing a smoother path:
7 → 2 → 4 → 14 → 6 → 1 → 12 → 15 → 8 → 3 → 9 → 13 → 5 → 10 → 7

Another attempt focusing on a cleaner loop:
7 → 10 → 2 → 4 → 14 → 6 → 1 → 12 → 15 → 8 → 3 → 5 → 13 → 9 → 11 → back to 7

Let me trace more carefully:
- Start at 7 (far left top)
- Go to 10 (nearby)
- Go to 13 (right of 10)
- Go to 5 (above 13)
- Go to 3 (top right)
- Go to 8 (below 3)
- Go to 15 (right of 8)
- Go to 12 (below 15)
- Go to 1 (right, below 12)
- Go to 6 (left of 1)
- Go to 14 (below 6)
- Go to 11 (above 14)
- Go to 9 (above 11)
- Go to 4 (left side)
- Go to 2 (above 4)
- Back to 7

Final tour: 7, 10, 13, 5, 3, 8, 15, 12, 1, 6, 14, 4, 2, 9, 11

Wait, let me reconsider the path to avoid crossings:

7, 2, 10, 5, 13, 9, 8, 3, 15, 12, 1, 6, 14, 11, 4

**Answer:** 7, 2, 10, 5, 3, 8, 15, 12, 1, 6, 14, 4, 11, 9, 13
