I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 20 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (62, 190)
2. (678, 248)
3. (560, 330)
4. (255, 175)
5. (270, 195)
6. (370, 180)
7. (168, 355)
8. (160, 395)
9. (310, 285)
10. (520, 160)
11. (480, 410)
12. (565, 350)
13. (230, 380)
14. (530, 195)
15. (590, 330)
16. (565, 125)
17. (710, 248)
18. (78, 30)
19. (250, 55)
20. (600, 405)

Now I'll try to find a short tour by identifying clusters and connecting them efficiently.

Looking at the layout:
- Top left area: 18, 19
- Left side: 1, 7, 8, 13
- Middle: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Top right: 16, 10, 14
- Right side: 2, 17
- Bottom right: 3, 12, 15, 20, 11

Let me construct a tour by following a logical path:

Starting from 18 (top left), go to nearby 19, then down to 1, then to 4, 5, 6, then up to 10, 16, 14, then to 2, 17, down to 15, 3, 12, 20, 11, then back through 9, 13, 7, 8, and back to 18.

Let me reconsider for a better path:

18 → 19 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 7 → 8 → 13 → 9 → 11 → 20 → 12 → 3 → 15 → 17 → 2 → 14 → 10 → 16 → 6 → back to 18

Actually, let me trace a more efficient route:

18 → 19 → 6 → 16 → 10 → 14 → 2 → 17 → 15 → 3 → 12 → 20 → 11 → 9 → 13 → 8 → 7 → 1 → 5 → 4 → 18

Let me refine this:

18 → 19 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 10 → 16 → 14 → 2 → 17 → 15 → 3 → 12 → 20 → 11 → 9 → 13 → 8 → 7 → 1 → 18

This creates a reasonable loop. Let me verify the path makes geographical sense by checking the flow.

**Final Answer:**

18, 19, 4, 5, 6, 10, 16, 14, 2, 17, 15, 3, 12, 20, 11, 9, 13, 8, 7, 1
