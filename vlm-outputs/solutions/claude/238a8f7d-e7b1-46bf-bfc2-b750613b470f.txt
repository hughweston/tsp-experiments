I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (400, 160)
- Point 2: (540, 180)
- Point 3: (210, 220)
- Point 4: (640, 45)
- Point 5: (480, 355)
- Point 6: (95, 25)
- Point 7: (600, 210)
- Point 8: (540, 95)
- Point 9: (605, 355)
- Point 10: (165, 490)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all points. Let me analyze the positions and look for a logical path that minimizes backtracking.

Looking at the layout:
- Point 6 is in the top-left
- Point 4 is in the top-right
- Point 8 is near the top-right area
- Points 2, 7 are in the middle-right
- Point 1 is in the middle
- Point 3 is in the middle-left
- Points 5, 9 are in the lower-middle/right
- Point 10 is in the bottom-left

Let me try to trace a tour that forms a logical loop without too many crossings:

Starting from point 6 (top-left), going clockwise:
6 → 4 (top-right) → 8 (below 4) → 2 (below 8) → 7 (right of 2) → 9 (bottom-right) → 5 (left of 9) → 10 (bottom-left) → 3 (up from 10) → 1 (middle) → back to 6

Let me check another route:
6 → 3 → 1 → 8 → 4 → 7 → 2 → 9 → 5 → 10 → 6

Or trying to make a cleaner loop:
6 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 2 → 9 → 5 → 10 → 3 → 1 → 6

Let me reconsider by grouping nearby points:
- Top cluster: 6, 4, 8
- Middle cluster: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Bottom cluster: 5, 9, 10

A good tour might be:
6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 9 → 7 → 2 → 8 → 4 → 1 → 6

Or: 6 → 4 → 8 → 2 → 7 → 9 → 5 → 10 → 3 → 1 → 6

This creates a roughly circular path. Let me verify this makes sense geometrically - it goes from top-left to top-right, down the right side, across the bottom, and back up the left side.
