I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (350, 430)
- Point 2: (290, 50)
- Point 3: (45, 250)
- Point 4: (480, 150)
- Point 5: (40, 400)
- Point 6: (570, 435)
- Point 7: (225, 95)
- Point 8: (70, 85)
- Point 9: (120, 90)
- Point 10: (560, 280)

Now I need to find a short tour. Let me analyze the positions:
- Points 8, 9, 7 are clustered in the upper left area
- Point 2 is in the upper middle
- Point 4 is in the upper right
- Point 10 is on the right side
- Point 6 is in the lower right
- Point 1 is in the lower middle
- Point 5 is in the lower left
- Point 3 is on the left side

Let me try to find a tour that follows a logical path without too many crossings:

Starting from point 5 (lower left), I can try a roughly circular path:
5 → 3 → 8 → 9 → 7 → 2 → 4 → 10 → 6 → 1 → back to 5

Let me verify this makes sense geographically:
- 5 (lower left) → 3 (left middle) → 8 (upper left) → 9 (near 8) → 7 (upper middle-left) → 2 (upper middle) → 4 (upper right) → 10 (right middle) → 6 (lower right) → 1 (lower middle) → back to 5

This forms a reasonable loop around the perimeter.

Let me check an alternative:
5 → 1 → 6 → 10 → 4 → 2 → 7 → 9 → 8 → 3 → back to 5

Both are essentially the same tour in opposite directions.

Let me verify there's no better path by checking if any points should be visited differently. The cluster 8-9-7-2 should be visited together, and 4-10-6 on the right should be connected.

My answer: **5, 3, 8, 9, 7, 2, 4, 10, 6, 1**
