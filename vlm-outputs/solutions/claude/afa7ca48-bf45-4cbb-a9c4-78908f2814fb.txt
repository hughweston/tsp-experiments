I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 10 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (310, 165)
- Point 2: (130, 390)
- Point 3: (35, 295)
- Point 4: (130, 190)
- Point 5: (600, 245)
- Point 6: (355, 95)
- Point 7: (340, 215)
- Point 8: (105, 235)
- Point 9: (520, 330)
- Point 10: (680, 215)

Now I need to find a short tour connecting all points. Let me try to identify clusters and find a logical path.

Looking at the layout:
- Left side: Points 3, 8, 4, 2
- Middle: Points 1, 6, 7
- Right side: Points 5, 9, 10

Let me try to construct a tour that doesn't cross itself:

Starting from point 3 (bottom left), I'll try to make a smooth loop:
- 3 → 8 (nearby, going up)
- 8 → 4 (nearby, going up-right)
- 4 → 1 (going right)
- 1 → 6 (going up)
- 6 → 7 (going down)
- 7 → 5 (going right)
- 5 → 10 (going right)
- 10 → 9 (going down-left)
- 9 → 2 (going left-down)
- 2 → 3 (going left-up to complete)

Let me verify this makes sense and check for a better route:

Alternative: 3 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 1 → 4 → 8 → 3

Let me reconsider the path to minimize backtracking:
- 2 is at bottom middle-left
- 9 is at bottom right area

A good tour might be:
3 → 8 → 4 → 1 → 6 → 7 → 5 → 10 → 9 → 2 → 3

Or going the other direction around the bottom:
3 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 5 → 7 → 6 → 1 → 4 → 8 → 3

Both seem reasonable. Let me check if 7 → 5 or going through 9 first makes more sense given positions.

The tour: 3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 7, 5, 10, 9, 2

This creates a roughly circular path without too many crossings.

**Answer:** 3, 8, 4, 1, 6, 7, 5, 10, 9, 2
