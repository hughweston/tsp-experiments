I need to find the shortest tour that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first identify the approximate coordinates of each point from the image:

1. (420, 470)
2. (155, 78)
3. (390, 248)
4. (375, 28)
5. (28, 268)
6. (330, 118)
7. (95, 438)
8. (480, 78)
9. (460, 298)
10. (720, 178)
11. (78, 238)
12. (435, 378)
13. (295, 338)
14. (560, 198)
15. (168, 228)
16. (530, 458)
17. (740, 268)
18. (365, 398)
19. (200, 398)
20. (270, 78)
21. (620, 408)
22. (315, 218)
23. (138, 308)
24. (95, 368)
25. (640, 258)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by looking for nearest neighbors and trying to avoid crossing paths.

Starting from the left side and working around:
- Cluster on left: 5, 11, 15, 23, 24, 7, 19
- Top cluster: 2, 20, 4, 6, 8
- Middle: 22, 3, 13, 18
- Right side: 10, 17, 25, 14, 9
- Bottom right: 21, 16, 1, 12

Let me trace a logical tour avoiding crossings:

Starting from point 5 (far left), going up and around:
5 → 11 → 15 → 23 → 24 → 7 → 19 → 13 → 18 → 1 → 16 → 21 → 12 → 9 → 25 → 17 → 10 → 14 → 8 → 4 → 6 → 20 → 2 → 22 → 3 → back to 5

Let me reconsider for a better path:

5 → 11 → 15 → 2 → 20 → 6 → 4 → 8 → 10 → 17 → 25 → 14 → 9 → 21 → 16 → 1 → 12 → 18 → 13 → 3 → 22 → 23 → 19 → 24 → 7 → back to 5

Refining further to minimize backtracking:

5 → 11 → 15 → 22 → 2 → 20 → 6 → 4 → 8 → 10 → 17 → 25 → 14 → 9 → 3 → 12 → 21 → 16 → 1 → 18 → 13 → 19 → 23 → 24 → 7 → back to 5

**Answer:**
5, 11, 15, 22, 2, 20, 6, 4, 8, 10, 17, 25, 14, 9, 3, 12, 21, 16, 1, 18, 13, 19, 23, 24, 7
