I need to find the shortest tour that visits all 15 points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Let me first estimate the coordinates of each point from the image:
- Point 1: (595, 155)
- Point 2: (245, 430)
- Point 3: (190, 105)
- Point 4: (560, 295)
- Point 5: (480, 295)
- Point 6: (435, 455)
- Point 7: (600, 345)
- Point 8: (580, 400)
- Point 9: (305, 235)
- Point 10: (25, 340)
- Point 11: (35, 275)
- Point 12: (365, 75)
- Point 13: (500, 45)
- Point 14: (250, 325)
- Point 15: (95, 390)

Now I'll work on finding a short tour by considering geographical clusters and avoiding crossing paths.

Looking at the layout:
- Top area: 13, 12, 3
- Right side: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Middle: 5, 9, 14
- Bottom: 6, 2
- Left side: 10, 11, 15

Let me trace a tour that moves efficiently through these regions:

Starting from point 13 (top right), going to nearby points:
13 → 12 → 3 → 11 → 10 → 15 → 2 → 6 → 8 → 7 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 9 → 14 → back to 13

Let me reconsider by looking at a more logical path:

13 → 1 → 12 → 3 → 9 → 14 → 11 → 10 → 15 → 2 → 6 → 8 → 7 → 4 → 5 → 13

Actually, let me trace a cleaner route:
- Start at 13 (top), go to 12, then 3 (upper left)
- Down to 9, then 14
- Left to 11, 10, 15
- Down to 2, across to 6
- Up to 8, 7, 4, 5
- Up to 1, back to 13

Route: 13 → 12 → 3 → 9 → 14 → 11 → 10 → 15 → 2 → 6 → 8 → 7 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 13

Let me verify another option:
3 → 12 → 13 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 6 → 2 → 15 → 10 → 11 → 14 → 9 → 3

This creates a roughly circular path.

**3, 12, 13, 1, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 14, 9, 5**

Wait, let me reconsider point 5's position - it should be included more naturally.

Final answer:
**3, 12, 13, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 14, 9**
