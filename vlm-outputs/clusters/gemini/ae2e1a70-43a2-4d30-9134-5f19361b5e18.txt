Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 2, 6, 10, 7
(These points are located in the upper-left quadrant of the image. While 7 is a bit of an outlier, it is closer to this group than any other.)

**Cluster 2:** 1, 4
(These two points form a distinct pair in the top-right corner.)

**Cluster 3:** 3, 9
(These two points are positioned close together in the middle-right area.)

**Cluster 4:** 5, 8
(These two points form a separate pair at the bottom of the image.)
