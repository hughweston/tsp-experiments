Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1 (Top Left):**
This group is situated in the upper-left corner of the image.
*   17, 8, 20, 5

**Cluster 2 (Center Left):**
This group is somewhat scattered but forms a loose collection on the left side, below the top group.
*   6, 15, 2, 9, 24, 1

**Cluster 3 (Top Center - Isolated):**
This point is relatively isolated near the top center.
*   12

**Cluster 4 (Right Side / Main Cluster):**
The majority of the remaining points form a large, somewhat connected group on the right side of the image. This could potentially be split further, but they are spatially closer to each other than to the other groups.
*   19, 10, 21, 4, 16, 3, 23, 7, 14, 22, 11, 13, 25, 18

**Alternative Clustering (More granular split of the Right Side):**

If we look for tighter groupings on the right side:

**Cluster 1 (Top Left):**
*   17, 8, 20, 5

**Cluster 2 (Center Left):**
*   6, 2, 9, 24, 1, 15

**Cluster 3 (Top Center):**
*   12

**Cluster 4 (Center Right):**
*   19, 21, 10

**Cluster 5 (Bottom Right):**
*   4, 16, 3, 23, 7, 14, 22, 11, 13, 25, 18
