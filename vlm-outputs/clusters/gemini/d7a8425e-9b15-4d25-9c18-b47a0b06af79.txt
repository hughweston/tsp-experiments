Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 8, 9, 7, 2, 4
These points form an arc across the top of the image. Points 8, 9, and 7 are quite close, and 2 and 4 continue that upper grouping.

**Cluster 2:** 3, 5
These two points are isolated on the far left side of the image, vertically aligned with each other.

**Cluster 3:** 1, 6, 10
These points are located in the bottom-right quadrant. Points 1 and 6 are at the bottom, and point 10 is above them on the right side, forming a distinct group from the upper arc.
