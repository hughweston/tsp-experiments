Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, they can be grouped into distinct clusters as follows:

**Cluster 1:**
Points 3, 6, 10, 11
(These points form a loose line or arc at the top of the image.)

**Cluster 2:**
Points 5, 7, 12, 15
(These points are clustered together in the middle-left area.)

**Cluster 3:**
Points 4, 8
(These two points are isolated on the right side.)

**Cluster 4:**
Points 1, 2, 9, 13, 14
(These points are spread across the bottom of the image. Note: Point 14 is quite far to the left, but is vertically aligned with the bottom group more than any others. Alternatively, one could treat {1, 2, 9, 13, 14} as a broad bottom cluster, or perhaps separate {14, 2, 1, 9} and leave {13} separate, but grouping the bottom "row" is the most logical simple clustering.)
