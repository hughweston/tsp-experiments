Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1 (Top Left):**
22, 6, 23, 19

**Cluster 2 (Bottom Left):**
13, 24, 15

**Cluster 3 (Center / Middle):**
3, 18, 17, 14, 8, 21, 11, 25
*(Note: 25 is a bit of an outlier at the top, but closest to this central/upper group. 3, 11, 8, 17 form a loose central band).*

**Cluster 4 (Bottom Center):**
10, 5, 4, 20

**Cluster 5 (Top Right):**
1, 16, 9, 2, 7, 12
*(Points 1, 16, 9 form a tight group. 7 and 12 are below them. 2 is an outlier to the far right but closest to this group spatially).*
