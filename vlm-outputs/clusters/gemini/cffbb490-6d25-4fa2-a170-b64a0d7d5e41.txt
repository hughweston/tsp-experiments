Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 6, 7
(These two points are located closely together in the top-left area.)

**Cluster 2:** 1, 2
(These points are situated in the bottom-left area.)

**Cluster 3:** 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10
(These points form a broader group on the right side of the image. While spread out, they are distinctly separate from the left-side clusters.)
