Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a reasonable clustering:

**Cluster 1:**
1, 6, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 25
*(This is the main central/left group of points).*

**Cluster 2:**
2, 8, 10
*(These points form a small, lower-left group).*

**Cluster 3:**
3, 13, 16, 19, 22
*(These points are spread across the upper-middle area).*

**Cluster 4:**
4, 7, 9, 11, 18
*(These points form a distinct group in the lower-right area).*

**Cluster 5:**
5, 12, 24
*(These points are isolated on the far right edge).*
