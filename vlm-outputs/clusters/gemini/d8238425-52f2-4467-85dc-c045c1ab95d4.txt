Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1: Top-Left Group**
This small group is isolated in the upper-left corner.
*   8, 19

**Cluster 2: Central-Upper Group**
This is a large, fairly dense cluster in the top-middle area.
*   4, 12, 3, 20, 17, 30, 23, 15, 18, 28, 2, 21, 1

**Cluster 3: Right-Side Group**
These points form a distinct cluster on the far right side of the image.
*   24, 10, 25, 6, 5

**Cluster 4: Bottom-Left/Lower Group**
These points are scattered across the lower portion of the image, generally separated from the upper clusters by a gap.
*   14, 29, 16, 9, 11, 27, 22, 7, 26, 13
