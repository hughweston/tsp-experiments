Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1 (Top Left):**
This group forms a dense cluster in the upper left quadrant of the image.
Points: 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 30

**Cluster 2 (Center/Right):**
These points are loosely scattered across the upper-middle and center-right area.
Points: 2, 3, 9, 18, 28

**Cluster 3 (Bottom Right):**
This is a larger grouping in the lower right, though it could potentially be split further, they form a cohesive "island" compared to the other groups.
Points: 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 17, 21, 24, 25, 26, 29

**Cluster 4 (Bottom Left):**
These three points are isolated at the very bottom left.
Points: 6, 8, 12
