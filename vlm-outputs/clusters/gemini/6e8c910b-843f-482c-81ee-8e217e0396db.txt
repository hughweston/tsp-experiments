Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 4, 3
*   These two points are isolated in the bottom-left corner.

**Cluster 2:** 1, 2, 10, 9
*   These points form a loose band in the middle area of the plot, separate from the corners.

**Cluster 3:** 6, 8
*   These two points are very close together in the top-right corner.

**Cluster 4:** 7, 5
*   These points are somewhat isolated on the right side, although 7 is closer to the top cluster than 5 is. Alternatively, 7 could be grouped with 6 and 8, but 5 is definitely quite far away on its own or loosely connected to the right side. A stricter grouping might just leave 5 isolated or group 7 and 5 as the "right-side" outliers. Let's look closer. 7 is quite far from 5. 5 is in the bottom right. 7 is in the middle right.

Let's refine the clusters for better cohesion:

*   **Group A (Bottom Left):** Points 4 and 3 are clearly together.
*   **Group B (Central/Left):** Points 1 and 2 are a tight pair. Points 10 and 9 are also in this central region. It makes sense to group 1, 2, 10, and 9 together as a central cluster.
*   **Group C (Top Right):** Points 6 and 8 are very close. Point 7 is the next closest to them.
*   **Group D (Bottom Right):** Point 5 stands alone in the bottom right. Depending on the clustering strictness, it could be its own cluster or grouped with the nearest neighbor (7), though the distance is large.

Let's go with a 3-cluster solution that captures the main regions:

**Cluster 1:** 4, 3
(Bottom-left region)

**Cluster 2:** 1, 2, 9, 10
(Central diagonal band)

**Cluster 3:** 6, 8, 7, 5
(Right-side region. While 5 is far, it belongs to the "right" group more than the "center" group. Alternatively, 5 can be separate.)

Let's provide a 4-cluster solution which seems most natural given the distinct gaps:

**Cluster 1:** 3, 4
**Cluster 2:** 1, 2, 9, 10
**Cluster 3:** 6, 7, 8
**Cluster 4:** 5
