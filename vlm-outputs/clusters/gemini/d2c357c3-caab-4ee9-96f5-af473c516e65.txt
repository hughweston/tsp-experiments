Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** This group occupies the upper region of the image.
Cluster 1: 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19

**Cluster 2:** This group is located in the bottom-left area.
Cluster 2: 1, 9, 20

**Cluster 3:** This is a small, tighter pairing in the lower-middle area.
Cluster 3: 12, 16

**Cluster 4:** These are isolated or outlier points that don't fit tightly with the main groups but can form their own sparse group or individual clusters. Based on general proximity:
Cluster 4: 3, 5, 6, 8, 17
