Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 4, 13
(This is a small group located at the bottom-center/left of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 3, 10, 12, 15
(This group is located on the mid-left side.)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 9
(These two points form a pair in the upper-middle area.)

**Cluster 4:** 5
(This point is isolated in the top-right corner.)

**Cluster 5:** 8
(This point is isolated on the far-left edge.)

**Cluster 6:** 6, 7, 11
(These points are generally located in the bottom-right quadrant, although 6 is slightly separated from the pair 7 and 11, they are closer to each other than to other groups.)

**Cluster 7:** 14
(This point is somewhat central but relatively isolated from the others.)

**Simplified Clustering (grouping broader areas):**

**Cluster 1:** 3, 8, 10, 12, 15 (Left side group)
**Cluster 2:** 1, 4, 13 (Bottom-left group)
**Cluster 3:** 2, 5, 9, 14 (Upper/Middle scattered group)
**Cluster 4:** 6, 7, 11 (Bottom-right group)

**Most Distinct Grouping:**

Cluster 1: 3, 10, 12, 15
Cluster 2: 1, 4, 13
Cluster 3: 2, 9
Cluster 4: 7, 11
Cluster 5: 6
Cluster 6: 14
Cluster 7: 5
Cluster 8: 8
