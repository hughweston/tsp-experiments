Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 2, 5
(These two points are very close together in the upper right corner.)

**Cluster 2:** 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13
(This group forms a cluster in the lower middle/right section. Points 4 and 13 are a bit higher but align vertically with the tighter group of 6, 8, 9 below them. Point 1 is also nearby.)

**Cluster 3:** 3, 7, 11, 12, 15
(These points are spread across the upper left and top middle area. They are generally separated from the lower groups.)

**Cluster 4:** 10, 14
(These two points are isolated in the bottom left area.)
