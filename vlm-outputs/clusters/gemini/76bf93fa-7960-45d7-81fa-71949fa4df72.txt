Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 4, 8, 5, 7
These points are located in the upper-left quadrant of the image and form a loose group.

**Cluster 2:** 9, 6, 10, 13
These points are spread across the upper-right area.

**Cluster 3:** 1, 11
These two points are very close to each other in the center of the image.

**Cluster 4:** 15, 14, 12
These points form a group on the lower-left side. (Note: Point 12 is quite far down, but 14 acts as a bridge between 15 and 12). Alternatively, 12 could be an outlier, but it aligns vertically with this side.

**Cluster 5:** 2, 3
These points are located in the lower-right area.
