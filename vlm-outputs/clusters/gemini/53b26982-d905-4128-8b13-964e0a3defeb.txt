Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
(This group forms an arc at the top of the image. Point 12 is a bit of an outlier but is closer to this upper arc than any other group.)

**Cluster 2:** 4, 7, 13
(These points are grouped on the left side, distinct from the upper arc.)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 14, 15
(These points form a loose group in the lower-middle section.)

**Cluster 4:** 3, 5
(These two points are isolated in the bottom right corner.)
