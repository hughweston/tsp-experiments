Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:**
10, 7, 15, 12, 19, 18
(These points form a loose group in the upper-right quadrant, though 18 and 19 are slightly separated, they are closer to this group than others.)

**Cluster 2:**
1, 2, 6, 8, 13
(These points are located in the lower-right area. 13 is a bit of an outlier but closest to this group.)

**Cluster 3:**
3, 5, 20, 16, 17, 9, 4, 11
(This is the largest central and lower-left group. Points 4 and 11 are somewhat bridging towards the center, but group well with the scattered set on the left.)

**Cluster 4:**
14
(This point is an outlier in the far top-left corner and doesn't group closely with any other points.)
