Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 5
(These points are located close together on the far left side of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 6, 7
(These points are grouped together near the top center/right of the image.)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 4
(These points form a loose group in the middle-right area.)

**Cluster 4:** 3, 8, 9, 10
(These points are located along the bottom of the image. 8 is bottom-left, 9 and 10 are bottom-center, and 3 is slightly higher and to the right, but closest to this bottom group.)
