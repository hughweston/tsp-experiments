Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 6, 14
(These points are in the top-left area, relatively isolated from the others.)

**Cluster 2:** 10, 17, 18, 19
(These points form a group on the far left/middle-left side.)

**Cluster 3:** 5, 9, 12, 13, 16
(These points are centrally located, forming a loose diagonal grouping.)

**Cluster 4:** 4, 11, 20
(These points are clustered in the top-right area.)

**Cluster 5:** 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 15
(These points are in the bottom-right and lower-middle area. Points 1, 2, and 7 are very clearly aligned, and 3, 8, and 15 are close enough to be considered part of this larger right-side group.)
