Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering into groups:

**Cluster 1:** 8, 15, 4, 14
(These points are grouped in the upper-left quadrant.)

**Cluster 2:** 6, 3, 5
(These points form a loose line or group in the lower-left to bottom-center area.)

**Cluster 3:** 11, 1, 9, 7, 2, 13, 10, 12
(These points are clustered on the right side of the image. You could potentially subdivide this further, but they form a distinct large group compared to the others.)
