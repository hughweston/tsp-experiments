Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 4
(This point is isolated in the top-left corner, far from others.)

**Cluster 2:** 1
(This point is isolated in the top-right area, distinct from the main groups.)

**Cluster 3:** 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 15, 13
(This is a large group on the left side of the image. Points 5, 14, 12, and 15 form a tight bottom-left cluster. Points 3 and 6 are just above/right of them, and 13 is nearby at the bottom. They are all closer to each other than to the right-side points.)

**Cluster 4:** 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
(This group occupies the right side of the image. Points 7, 10, and 11 form a clear subgroup at the bottom right. Point 9 is above them. Points 2 and 8 are spatially bridging the gap towards the center but are clearly more associated with the right-side group than the left.)

**Alternative (Simpler 2-Cluster Split):**

**Cluster 1:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15
(All points on the left half of the image).

**Cluster 2:** 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
(All points on the right half of the image).
