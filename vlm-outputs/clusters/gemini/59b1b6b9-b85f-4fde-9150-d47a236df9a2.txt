Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 3, 4, 6, 10
(These points form a loose group in the upper-left and central area of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 2, 8, 9
(These points are situated towards the upper-right and far-right side of the image.)

**Cluster 3:** 5, 7
(These two points are isolated at the bottom of the image.)
