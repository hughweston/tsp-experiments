Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical grouping into clusters:

**Cluster 1: Left-side group**
These points are clustered relatively closely together on the left half of the image.
*   16, 21, 20, 7, 11, 9, 5, 25, 1, 22, 19, 12

**Cluster 2: Top-center group**
These points form a loose cluster near the top center.
*   23, 14, 15

**Cluster 3: Right-side group**
These points are distributed on the right side of the image.
*   3, 17, 13, 18, 4, 24

**Cluster 4: Bottom-center group**
These points form a distinct line or curve at the bottom.
*   8, 2, 10, 6
