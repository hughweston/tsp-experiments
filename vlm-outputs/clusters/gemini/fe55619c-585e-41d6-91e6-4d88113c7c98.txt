Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1 (Left):**
9, 10, 18, 17, 5, 8
*(These points are grouped on the left side of the image. Note: Point 8 is a bit of an outlier at the top, but is closer to the left group than the right.)*

**Cluster 2 (Center/Bottom-Left):**
1, 11, 15
*(These form a loose group in the lower-middle-left region.)*

**Cluster 3 (Bottom/Center):**
2, 7, 13, 14
*(These points are situated in the bottom-middle area.)*

**Cluster 4 (Top Right):**
4, 16, 19, 12, 3
*(This is a distinct group in the upper-right quadrant.)*

**Cluster 5 (Bottom Right):**
6, 20
*(These two points are isolated together in the far bottom-right corner.)*
