Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1: Left / Bottom-Left Group**
These points form a loose group on the left side of the image.
12, 16, 20, 10, 18, 2, 6, 8

**Cluster 2: Central Group**
These points are located towards the center of the image.
5, 7, 3, 1, 19, 4

**Cluster 3: Right Group**
These points form a cluster on the far right side.
13, 17, 14, 11, 15

**Cluster 4: Top / Isolated Point**
Point 9 is located at the very top, quite separated from the main central cluster, though it could arguably be grouped with the central points.
