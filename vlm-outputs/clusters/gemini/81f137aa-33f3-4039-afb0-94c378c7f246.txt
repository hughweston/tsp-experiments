Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, here are the clusters:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 4, 6, 8, 10
(These points are grouped on the left side of the image. Points 1 and 4 are at the top, while 6, 8, and 10 are slightly lower but vertically aligned in the same general left-hand column.)

**Cluster 2:** 3, 9
(These two points form a distinct pair at the top right of the image.)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 7
(These points are clustered together in the bottom right corner.)

**Cluster 4:** 5
(Point 5 is relatively isolated in the lower-middle section, distinct enough to be considered on its own or loosely associated with the left group, but spatially it stands somewhat apart.)

**Alternative Grouping (3 Clusters):**
If you prefer fewer, broader groups:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 5
(The entire left and lower-left side)

**Cluster 2:** 3, 9
(Top right)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 7
(Bottom right)
