Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1 (Central-Left Group):**
This group is situated in the middle-left area of the plot.
*   5, 7, 14, 15, 16, 23, 25, 26

**Cluster 2 (Central-Right Group):**
This group is located to the right of Cluster 1, forming a separate density.
*   2, 11, 20, 27

**Cluster 3 (Bottom-Right Group):**
These points are loosely gathered in the lower-right quadrant.
*   10, 12, 17, 21, 22, 28

**Cluster 4 (Top-Right Group):**
These points are isolated in the far upper-right corner.
*   1, 9, 29

**Cluster 5 (Left & Sparse Outliers):**
These points are spread out on the far left side and top, generally distant from the main central clusters.
*   3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 18, 19, 24, 30
