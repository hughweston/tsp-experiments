Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:**
These points are located on the far right side of the image.
*   8, 9, 14

**Cluster 2:**
These points form a loose group in the upper-left to middle-top area.
*   1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18

**Cluster 3:**
These points form a group in the lower-left area.
*   2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 19, 20

***

*Self-Correction/Refinement:*
If we look closer, we might separate Cluster 2 and 3 differently, or break them down further, but a simple 3-cluster split seems most natural.
*   **The Right Group:** Points 8, 9, and 14 are clearly separated from the rest by a large white space.
*   **The Top-Left Group:** Points 5, 6, 18, 15, 10, 4, 16, 1, 13, 17 form a coherent upper cluster.
*   **The Bottom-Left Group:** Points 12, 19, 11, 3, 2, 20, 7 form a coherent lower cluster.

So, the final answer is:

Cluster 1: 8, 9, 14
Cluster 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18
Cluster 3: 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 19, 20
