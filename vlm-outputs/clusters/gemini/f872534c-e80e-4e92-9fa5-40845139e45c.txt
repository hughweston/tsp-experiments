Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 7, 2, 10
These points form a loose group on the left side of the image.

**Cluster 2:** 5, 13, 9, 8, 3, 15
These points are clustered in the upper and upper-right region. While 15 is a bit further out, it aligns best with the upper group.

**Cluster 3:** 4, 14, 6, 1, 11, 12
These points form a distinct group in the lower and lower-right portion of the image.
