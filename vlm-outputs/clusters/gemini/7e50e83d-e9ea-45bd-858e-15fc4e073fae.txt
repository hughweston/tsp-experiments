Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1
(This point is located far away from all other points in the bottom left corner, making it an outlier or a cluster of its own.)

**Cluster 2:** 3, 9, 10
(These three points form a distinct group in the upper-left region of the image.)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 4, 6, 7
(These points are clustered together in the upper-right section. Points 2, 4, and 7 are quite close, and 6 is nearby in the top right corner.)

**Cluster 4:** 5, 8
(These two points form a loose pair in the lower-middle/right area, separated from the upper groups.)
