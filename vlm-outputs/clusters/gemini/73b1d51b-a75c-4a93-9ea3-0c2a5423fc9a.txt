Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 9, 7
These two points are located in the bottom-left area and are relatively close to each other compared to the rest.

**Cluster 2:** 10
Point 10 is isolated in the top-left corner, far from other groups.

**Cluster 3:** 3, 1, 2, 8
This group forms a loose chain in the center-top region. Points 3 and 1 are close, and 2 and 8 are nearby in the upper section.

**Cluster 4:** 4, 5
These two points are located in the bottom-right corner.

**Cluster 5:** 6
Point 6 is isolated on the far right edge.
