Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 8, 11, 14
(These points are grouped in the top-right corner.)

**Cluster 2:** 9, 6
(These two points are isolated on the far right side.)

**Cluster 3:** 7, 15
(These two points are very close to each other near the top-center.)

**Cluster 4:** 1, 4, 5, 2, 13, 10
(This is a looser group forming a band across the middle-left area. Points 10, 13, and 2 form a tight line, and 1, 4, 5 are nearby.)

**Cluster 5:** 12, 3
(These two points are located in the bottom-left area.)
