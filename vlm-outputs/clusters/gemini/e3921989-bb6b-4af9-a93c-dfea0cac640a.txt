Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 3, 15, 17
These points form a tight group in the upper-left corner. (Point 5 is somewhat isolated but closest to this group, or could be its own single-point cluster. I will group it with the nearest large cluster below).

**Cluster 2:** 1, 8, 11, 14, 19
This group is located in the upper-middle area. Point 7 is further to the right but spatially related to this upper band. Point 5 is also in the upper band. Let's refine based on local density.
*   **Refined Cluster 2:** 1, 8, 11, 14, 19
    *   (Optional: Points 5 and 7 are outliers. 5 is between Cluster 1 and 2. 7 is far right. Often outliers are grouped with the nearest neighbor or kept separate. I will group them into the "Northern" clusters.)

**Cluster 3:** 12, 13
These two points are isolated in the bottom-left corner.

**Cluster 4:** 2, 16, 20
These three points form a horizontal line in the bottom-middle area.

**Cluster 5:** 4, 6, 18
These points are grouped together in the lower-right area.

**Cluster 6:** 9, 10
These two points are on the far right edge.

**Outliers:**
*   **Point 5:** Located between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. It is spatially closest to Cluster 1 or 2. I will add it to the upper-left group (Cluster 1) or keep it separate. Let's add it to Cluster 1 for a broader "North West" group.
*   **Point 7:** Located in the far top-right. It is closest to Cluster 2.

**Finalized Grouping:**

Cluster 1: 3, 5, 15, 17
Cluster 2: 1, 7, 8, 11, 14, 19
Cluster 3: 12, 13
Cluster 4: 2, 16, 20
Cluster 5: 4, 6, 18
Cluster 6: 9, 10
