Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 2, 6, 8, 11
(These points are grouped on the far left side of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 5, 7
(These two points form a small pair near the top-center.)

**Cluster 3:** 3, 9, 12, 14
(These points are clustered in the top-right quadrant.)

**Cluster 4:** 10, 13, 15
(These points form a tight group in the center/lower-center.)

**Cluster 5:** 4
(Point 4 is isolated at the bottom right, far away from other groups, making it a single-point cluster or an outlier.)
