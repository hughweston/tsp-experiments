Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** This group consists of the points scattered across the upper region of the image.
*   **7, 6, 19, 5, 1**

**Cluster 2:** This group is located on the far right side.
*   **20, 2**

**Cluster 3:** This is the large, elongated group of points running along the bottom left and center.
*   **9, 14, 17, 18, 4, 15, 16, 11, 13, 3, 8, 10, 12**

*(Note: Cluster 3 could potentially be split further, for instance separating the leftmost points [9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 4] from the center-bottom points [16, 11, 13, 3, 8, 10, 12], but grouping them as one large bottom "band" is the most distinct separation from the upper points.)*
