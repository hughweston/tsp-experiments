Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical grouping into clusters:

**Cluster 1: [2, 3, 4, 8]**
*   These points form a distinct group on the left side of the image. Point 2 is slightly lower, but it is horizontally aligned with the vertical band formed by 3, 8, and 4.

**Cluster 2: [1, 6, 7]**
*   These points are clustered in the upper-middle area. Point 6 is at the top, and points 1 and 7 are close below it, forming a tight triangle.

**Cluster 3: [5, 9, 10]**
*   These points are on the right side. Points 5 and 10 are very close together on the far right. Point 9 is lower down but is horizontally much closer to 5 and 10 than to the middle group, making this the most natural grouping. Alternatively, point 9 could be considered an outlier, but usually, it fits best with the right-most group.
