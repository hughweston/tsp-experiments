Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 9, 1
(These two points form a distinct group on the far left side of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 4, 10, 6, 7
(These points are grouped together in the upper right quadrant. Point 7 is a bit further out but is clearly associated with the general upper-right region compared to the bottom points.)

**Cluster 3:** 5, 8, 3, 2
(These points form a loose line or group along the bottom right section of the image.)
