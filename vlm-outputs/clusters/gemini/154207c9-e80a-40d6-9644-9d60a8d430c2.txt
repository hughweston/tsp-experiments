Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 10, 11, 15
(These points are grouped on the far left side of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 2, 6, 8, 7
(These points form a loose chain along the bottom edge.)

**Cluster 3:** 4, 5, 1, 7, 8
*Correction*: Looking closer at the right side, 7 and 8 are quite close to 4 and 5, but 1 is also nearby. However, a cleaner separation might be:
- **Cluster 2 (Bottom):** 2, 6, 8, 7
- **Cluster 3 (Middle Right):** 4, 5, 1
Let's re-evaluate. The points 4, 5, 7, 8 seem to form a group on the lower right, with 1 above them.
Let's try a broader grouping based on quadrants.

**Refined Clustering:**

**Cluster 1 (Left):** 10, 11, 15
These three are isolated on the left edge.

**Cluster 2 (Center):** 3, 9, 12, 14
These points are loosely gathered in the middle/upper-middle area. Point 2 is a bit of an outlier below them, but could be grouped with the bottom set. Let's stick to the central column.

**Cluster 3 (Top Right):** 1, 13
Point 13 is at the very top. Point 1 is below it on the right. Point 12 is also near the top but more central.

**Cluster 4 (Bottom Right):** 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Points 4 and 5 are paired. Points 7 and 8 are paired below them. Point 6 is at the bottom. Point 2 is to the left of 6.

Let's try to simplify into fewer, more obvious groups.

**Cluster 1:** 10, 11, 15
(Left group)

**Cluster 2:** 3, 9, 12, 13, 14
(Central and Upper group. 3, 9, 14 form a vertical-ish line. 12 and 13 are the top points nearby.)

**Cluster 3:** 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
(Right-side group. 1 is upper right. 4, 5 are mid-right. 7, 8 are lower right.)

**Cluster 4:** 2, 6
(Bottom edge outliers, though 6 is close to 8 and 2 is somewhat near 14/15. It's often better to merge these into adjacent clusters).

Let's merge for a 3-cluster solution which is usually most robust:

**Cluster 1 (Left & Center-Low):** 2, 10, 11, 14, 15
Points 10, 11, 15 are the left edge. 14 and 2 are the next closest points moving inward.

**Cluster 2 (Top & Center-High):** 3, 9, 12, 13
These form the upper central region.

**Cluster 3 (Right & Bottom-Right):** 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
This covers the entire right flank of the image.

Let's try one more visual pass.
- **Group A:** 10, 11, 15 (Far left)
- **Group B:** 3, 9, 12, 14 (Central column)
- **Group C:** 1, 13 (Top right - though 13 is far)
- **Group D:** 4, 5, 7, 8 (Lower right cluster)
- **Group E:** 2, 6 (Bottom edge)

Combining closest neighbors:
**Cluster 1:** 10, 11, 15
**Cluster 2:** 3, 9, 12, 13, 14
**Cluster 3:** 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2 (Grouping the bottom outliers with the right side seems plausible, or 2 with the left).

Here is a balanced clustering based on visual density:

**Cluster 1:** 2, 10, 11, 14, 15
**Cluster 2:** 3, 9, 12, 13
**Cluster 3:** 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
