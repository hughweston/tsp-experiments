Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1 (Top Left):**
7, 27, 8, 19
*(These points form a loose group in the upper left quadrant.)*

**Cluster 2 (Top Center-Right):**
4, 11, 22, 30
*(These four points are clustered closely together near the top middle.)*

**Cluster 3 (Top Right Corner):**
21, 20, 2, 5
*(These points are grouped in the far top right.)*

**Cluster 4 (Middle Left):**
1, 15, 16, 24, 25, 28
*(This group spans the left side, from the very bottom corner up to point 15.)*

**Cluster 5 (Center):**
18, 26
*(These two points are isolated together in the central area.)*

**Cluster 6 (Bottom Center):**
12, 6, 13, 14
*(These points form a line or group along the bottom middle.)*

**Cluster 7 (Bottom Right):**
9, 3, 17, 23, 10, 29
*(This is a larger, looser group covering the bottom right quadrant.)*
