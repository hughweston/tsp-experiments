Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
(These points are grouped together in the upper-left quadrant of the image.)

**Cluster 2:** 4, 6, 9
(These points form a loose group in the middle-to-lower-left section.)

**Cluster 3:** 5, 10
(These points are isolated on the far right and bottom right of the image.)
