Based on the spatial arrangement of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 2, 4, 8, 1, 9
(These points are all located on the left side of the image, forming a somewhat loose vertical group.)

**Cluster 2:** 5, 7
(These two points are isolated on the far right side of the image.)

**Cluster 3:** 6, 10
(These two points form a pair in the central area.)

**Cluster 4:** 3
(This point is isolated at the bottom center, distinct from the other groups.)

*Alternatively, if broader groupings are preferred:*

**Cluster 1 (Left Group):** 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
**Cluster 2 (Center Group):** 3, 6, 10
**Cluster 3 (Right Group):** 5, 7
