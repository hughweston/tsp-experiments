Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here is a logical clustering:

**Cluster 1:** 5, 6, 14
(These three points are grouped closely together in the upper-left corner.)

**Cluster 2:** 1, 3, 11
(These points form a loose group on the mid-left side. Point 11 is furthest left, but still relatively close to 3 and 1 compared to other groups.)

**Cluster 3:** 2, 7, 10
(This group is in the lower-left area. Points 7 and 10 are very close, and point 2 is nearby to the right.)

**Cluster 4:** 9, 12
(These two points form a distinct pair in the upper-right corner.)

**Cluster 5:** 8, 13, 15
(These three points form a tight triangle in the lower-right corner.)

**Cluster 6:** 4
(This point is isolated in the center and doesn't strongly belong to any of the surrounding groups, though it could arguably be grouped with the left-side clusters if fewer clusters were required. Treating it as a singleton or outlier is spatially accurate.)
