Based on the spatial proximity of the points in the image, here are the clusters:

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Cluster 2: 5, 9
Cluster 3: 3, 6, 10

**Explanation:**
*   **Cluster 1:** Points 2, 4, 7, and 8 form a tight group in the upper right. Point 1 is relatively close to this group, acting as a bridge, so it is included here.
*   **Cluster 2:** Points 5 and 9 form a pair in the lower right-middle area.
*   **Cluster 3:** Points 3, 6, and 10 are on the left side. While spread out vertically, they form a loose group distinct from the right-side clusters. Alternatively, points 6, 3, and 10 could be considered separate individual outliers, but grouping them by "left side" is a reasonable spatial clustering. Another valid interpretation could just list them as separate single-point clusters or group 6 and 3 together and leave 10 alone. However, the 3-cluster split above covers the main spatial zones (Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Right).
