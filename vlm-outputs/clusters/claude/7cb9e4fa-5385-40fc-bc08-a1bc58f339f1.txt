I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 5: upper left area
- Point 6: upper middle area
- Point 14: left side, below 5
- Point 9: right side, upper
- Point 12: right side, near 9
- Point 3: left-center area
- Point 11: far left, middle
- Point 1: center-left
- Point 4: center-right
- Point 7: lower left
- Point 10: lower left, below 7
- Point 2: lower center
- Point 8: lower right
- Point 13: lower right, near 8
- Point 15: lower right, below 13

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper left cluster:** Points 5, 6, 14 (all in the upper portion, left-center)

**Left side cluster:** Points 3, 11, 1 (middle left area)

**Lower left cluster:** Points 7, 10 (bottom left corner)

**Center cluster:** Points 2, 4 (middle area)

**Right side cluster:** Points 9, 12 (upper right), 8, 13, 15 (lower right)

Let me reconsider to make more coherent clusters:

- Upper left group: 5, 6, 14
- Left middle group: 3, 11, 1
- Lower left group: 7, 10
- Lower center: 2
- Center-right: 4
- Right side group: 9, 12, 8, 13, 15

Consolidating into cleaner clusters:

Cluster 1: 5, 6, 14 (upper left region)
Cluster 2: 3, 11, 1, 7, 10 (left side)
Cluster 3: 2, 4 (center)
Cluster 4: 9, 12, 8, 13, 15 (right side)

Cluster 1: 5, 6, 14
Cluster 2: 3, 11, 1, 7, 10
Cluster 3: 2, 4
Cluster 4: 9, 12, 8, 13, 15
