I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 7, 20, 23 are in the upper-left area
- Points 2, 6, 12 are in the upper-middle-left area
- Points 1, 17, 13, 5 are on the left side, lower portion
- Points 11, 3 are in the lower-left area
- Points 10, 14, 8 are in the middle area
- Points 21, 19 are in the upper-middle-right area
- Points 22, 25 are in the upper-right area
- Points 16, 4, 18 are on the right side
- Points 15, 24, 9 are in the lower-right area

Looking at the distribution, the points seem to form a curved pattern from upper-left to lower-right. I can identify clusters based on spatial groupings:

**Left side cluster:** Points 5, 13, 1, 17, 11, 3, 20, 23 - these are clustered on the left portion of the image

**Upper-middle cluster:** Points 7, 2, 6, 12 - these form a group in the upper-middle-left area

**Center cluster:** Points 10, 14, 8, 21, 19 - these are in the middle transitional area

**Right side cluster:** Points 22, 25, 16, 4, 18, 15, 24, 9 - these are grouped on the right portion of the image

Cluster 1: 5, 13, 1, 11, 3, 20, 23, 17
Cluster 2: 7, 2, 6, 12
Cluster 3: 10, 14, 8, 21, 19
Cluster 4: 22, 25, 16, 4, 18, 15, 24, 9
