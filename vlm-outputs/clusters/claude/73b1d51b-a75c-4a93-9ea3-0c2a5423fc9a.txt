I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: middle area, center-right
- Point 2: upper-middle area
- Point 3: middle-left area
- Point 4: lower-right area
- Point 5: lower-right area (below point 4)
- Point 6: far right, upper area
- Point 7: left side, middle-lower area
- Point 8: upper area, center-right
- Point 9: far left, bottom area
- Point 10: upper-left area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper cluster:** Points 10, 8, 2 are in the upper portion of the image, relatively close together.

**Middle cluster:** Points 3, 1 are in the middle area, close to each other.

**Left-lower cluster:** Points 7, 9 are on the left side, lower portion.

**Right cluster:** Points 6, 4, 5 are on the right side of the image.

Let me refine this grouping:
- Points 10, 8, 2 form an upper group
- Points 3, 1 are close together in the middle
- Points 7, 9 are on the far left
- Points 4, 5, 6 are on the right side

Cluster 1: 8, 10, 2
Cluster 2: 1, 3
Cluster 3: 7, 9
Cluster 4: 4, 5, 6
