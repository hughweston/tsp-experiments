I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on their proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Upper left area: 2, 22, 8, 15, 3
- Upper middle area: 24, 12, 25, 1
- Upper right area: 10, 11, 7
- Middle area: 21, 4, 14
- Right side: 18, 13, 6
- Lower middle area: 5, 9, 17, 23, 19
- Lower right area: 20, 16

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Left side cluster:** Points 2, 22, 8, 15, 3, 19 - these are along the left edge

**Upper-middle cluster:** Points 24, 12, 25, 1, 21 - these are in the upper-middle region

**Upper-right cluster:** Points 10, 11, 7 - clustered together in upper right

**Right side cluster:** Points 4, 18, 13, 6, 20, 16 - along the right side

**Lower-middle cluster:** Points 5, 9, 17, 23, 14 - in the lower-middle area

Let me refine this based on closer inspection:

Cluster 1: 2, 22, 8, 15, 3, 19 (left side)
Cluster 2: 24, 12, 25, 1, 21 (upper-middle)
Cluster 3: 10, 11, 7 (upper-right)
Cluster 4: 4, 18, 13, 6, 14 (middle-right)
Cluster 5: 5, 9, 17, 23, 20, 16 (lower area)

**Final Answer:**

Cluster 1: 2, 22, 8, 15, 3, 19
Cluster 2: 24, 12, 25, 1, 21
Cluster 3: 10, 11, 7
Cluster 4: 4, 14, 18, 13, 6
Cluster 5: 5, 9, 17, 23, 20, 16
