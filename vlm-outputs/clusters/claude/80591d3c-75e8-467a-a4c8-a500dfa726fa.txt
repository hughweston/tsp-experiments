I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: far left, middle height
- Point 2: far right, middle-lower area
- Point 3: center-right, lower-middle area
- Point 4: center, middle area
- Point 5: upper left
- Point 6: upper right
- Point 7: upper center
- Point 8: lower left
- Point 9: lower center
- Point 10: lower center (slightly right of 9)

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 5, 7, 6 are all in the upper portion of the image
- Point 5: upper left
- Point 7: upper center
- Point 6: upper right

**Lower region cluster:** Points 8, 9, 10 are grouped in the lower portion
- Point 8: lower left
- Point 9: lower center
- Point 10: lower center

**Middle region cluster:** Points 1, 4, 3, 2 form a rough middle band
- Point 1: left middle
- Point 4: center middle
- Point 3: center-right, lower-middle
- Point 2: far right middle

Cluster 1: 5, 7, 6
Cluster 2: 8, 9, 10
Cluster 3: 1, 4, 3, 2
