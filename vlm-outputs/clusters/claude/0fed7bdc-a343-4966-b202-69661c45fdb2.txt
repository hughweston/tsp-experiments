I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 15: upper middle area
- Point 3: upper right area
- Point 12: upper left area
- Point 7: upper left-center area
- Point 2: right side, upper-middle
- Point 5: right side, near point 2
- Point 11: left side, middle
- Point 4: center
- Point 13: right-center
- Point 9: center-lower
- Point 6: center-lower
- Point 1: right side, lower-middle
- Point 8: center-lower
- Point 10: lower left
- Point 14: lower left-center

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:**
- Points 15, 3, 7, 12 are all in the upper portion of the image

**Right side cluster:**
- Points 2, 5, 13, 1 are grouped on the right side

**Center-lower cluster:**
- Points 4, 9, 6, 8 are clustered in the center-lower area

**Left side cluster:**
- Points 11, 10, 14 are on the left side

Let me verify these groupings make sense spatially:
- 12, 7, 15, 3 form an upper band
- 2, 5 are close together on the upper right; 13, 1 are on the right but lower
- 4, 9, 6, 8 are clustered in the middle-lower center
- 11, 10, 14 are on the left side

Cluster 1: 12, 7, 15, 3
Cluster 2: 2, 5, 13, 1
Cluster 3: 4, 9, 6, 8
Cluster 4: 11, 10, 14
