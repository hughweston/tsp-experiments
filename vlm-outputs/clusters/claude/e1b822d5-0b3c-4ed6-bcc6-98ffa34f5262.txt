I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 4: upper area, left-center
- Point 2: upper left area
- Point 5: right side, upper
- Point 8: left side, middle-upper
- Point 7: right side, middle
- Point 6: center
- Point 10: center-right
- Point 1: left side, lower-middle
- Point 9: left side, lower
- Point 3: center-bottom

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 2, 8, 1, 9 are all on the left side of the image, forming a vertical grouping.

**Right cluster:** Points 5, 7 are on the right side, relatively close to each other.

**Center cluster:** Points 6, 10 are in the center area, close together.

**Other points:** 
- Point 4 is in the upper left-center area, closer to the left group
- Point 3 is at the bottom center

Let me refine:
- Points 2, 4, 8, 1, 9 form a left-side cluster
- Points 5, 7 form a right-side cluster
- Points 6, 10, 3 form a center cluster

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
Cluster 2: 5, 7
Cluster 3: 3, 6, 10
