I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: lower left area
- Point 2: far left, middle-left height
- Point 3: upper right area
- Point 4: bottom right area
- Point 5: center-upper area
- Point 6: lower left area (near point 1)
- Point 7: center-right area
- Point 8: upper left area
- Point 9: right side, middle height
- Point 10: center, lower-middle area
- Point 11: upper left area (near point 8)
- Point 12: upper right area
- Point 13: center-lower area
- Point 14: right side, upper-middle
- Point 15: center-lower area (near points 10, 13)

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 1, 2, 6, 8, 11 are all on the left side of the image

**Center cluster:** Points 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 are in the central area of the image

**Right cluster:** Points 3, 4, 9, 12, 14 are on the right side of the image

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 6, 8, 11
Cluster 2: 5, 7, 10, 13, 15
Cluster 3: 3, 4, 9, 12, 14
