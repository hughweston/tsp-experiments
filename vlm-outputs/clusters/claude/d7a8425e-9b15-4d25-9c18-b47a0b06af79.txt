I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: middle-right area, lower portion
- Point 2: upper-middle area
- Point 3: left side, middle height
- Point 4: right side, upper-middle area
- Point 5: bottom-left corner
- Point 6: bottom-right area
- Point 7: upper-left quadrant
- Point 8: upper-left area
- Point 9: upper-left area (near 8)
- Point 10: right side, middle height

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper-left cluster**: Points 8, 9, and 7 are close together in the upper-left region.

**Upper-right cluster**: Points 2 and 4 are in the upper-middle to upper-right area.

**Left-middle cluster**: Point 3 is on the left side, somewhat isolated but closer to point 5.

**Bottom-left**: Point 5 is in the bottom-left corner, relatively close to point 3.

**Right side cluster**: Points 10, 6, and 1 are on the right side of the image in the lower-middle to bottom area.

Let me group these into logical clusters:

- Points 8, 9, 7 are very close together (upper-left)
- Point 2 is nearby but slightly separated, could join with 4
- Points 3 and 5 are on the left side
- Points 1, 6, 10 are on the right side, lower portion
- Point 4 is upper-right

Cluster 1: 7, 8, 9 (tight cluster in upper-left)
Cluster 2: 2, 4 (upper portion, center-right)
Cluster 3: 3, 5 (left side)
Cluster 4: 1, 6, 10 (right side, lower area)

Cluster 1: 7, 8, 9
Cluster 2: 2, 4
Cluster 3: 3, 5
Cluster 4: 1, 6, 10
