I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me map out the approximate positions of each point:

**Top region:**
- 8, 5 (upper left area)
- 17, 20 (left side, below 8)
- 12 (upper middle)

**Upper-middle left:**
- 6 (left side)
- 15 (center-left)
- 2 (center-left, below 6)

**Middle region:**
- 10, 21 (center)
- 19 (right side, upper)

**Center-right region:**
- 16, 3, 23 (right side, forming a horizontal cluster)
- 7 (right side, below 23)
- 14 (right side, below 7)
- 13 (far right, bottom)

**Lower-left region:**
- 9 (far left)
- 24 (lower left)
- 1 (center-left, lower)
- 18 (center, lower)
- 25 (center, bottom)
- 4 (center)

**Lower-middle:**
- 22, 11 (lower center-right)

Based on spatial proximity, I can identify these clusters:

**Cluster 1 (Upper left group):** 8, 5, 17, 20, 12

**Cluster 2 (Left-center group):** 6, 2, 15

**Cluster 3 (Lower-left and center group):** 9, 24, 1, 18, 25, 4

**Cluster 4 (Right side group):** 19, 21, 10, 16, 3, 23, 7, 14, 22, 11, 13

Let me refine this based on closer inspection:

Cluster 1: 5, 8, 12, 17, 20
Cluster 2: 6, 2, 15
Cluster 3: 9, 24, 1, 18, 25, 4
Cluster 4: 10, 21, 19, 16, 3, 23, 7, 14, 22, 11, 13
