I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 5: far right, top
- Point 9: upper middle area
- Point 2: upper middle, below 9
- Point 8: far left, upper-middle area
- Point 14: center-right area
- Point 10: left side, middle
- Point 3: left side, middle (near 10)
- Point 6: right side, middle-lower
- Point 15: left side, below 10
- Point 12: left side, near 15
- Point 11: far right, lower
- Point 7: right side, lower
- Point 13: center-left, lower
- Point 1: center, lower
- Point 4: center, lower (near 1)

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 8, 10, 3, 15, 12 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Center-lower cluster:** Points 13, 1, 4 - these are grouped together in the lower-center area

**Upper-middle cluster:** Points 9, 2, 14 - these form a diagonal group in the upper-middle region

**Right cluster:** Points 5, 6, 11, 7 - these are on the right side of the image

Cluster 1: 8, 10, 3, 15, 12
Cluster 2: 13, 1, 4
Cluster 3: 9, 2, 14
Cluster 4: 5, 6, 7, 11
