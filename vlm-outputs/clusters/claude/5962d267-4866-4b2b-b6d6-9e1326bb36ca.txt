I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: left-center area
- Point 2: upper-left area
- Point 3: bottom-center area
- Point 4: center-left area
- Point 5: center area
- Point 6: right side, lower
- Point 7: upper-center area
- Point 8: upper-right area
- Point 9: far right side
- Point 10: far left side
- Point 11: upper-right area
- Point 12: lower-left area
- Point 13: upper-left area (near point 2)
- Point 14: upper-right area
- Point 15: top-center area

Now let me identify spatial clusters:

**Upper-left cluster:** Points 2, 13 are close together in the upper-left region. Point 10 is on the far left but lower.

**Left-center cluster:** Points 1, 4, 12 are in the left-center to lower-left area. Point 10 could join this group.

**Center-top cluster:** Points 7, 15, 5 are in the upper-center area.

**Upper-right cluster:** Points 8, 11, 14 are grouped in the upper-right area.

**Right-side cluster:** Points 6, 9 are on the right side, lower portion.

**Bottom area:** Point 3 is at the bottom-center.

Let me refine these clusters:

Cluster 1 (Left side): 10, 2, 13, 1, 4, 12
Cluster 2 (Center-top): 7, 15, 5
Cluster 3 (Upper-right): 8, 11, 14
Cluster 4 (Right-lower): 6, 9
Cluster 5 (Bottom): 3

Let me consolidate for clearer groupings:

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 13 (left region)
Cluster 2: 3, 5, 7, 15 (center region)
Cluster 3: 6, 8, 9, 11, 14 (right region)

**Final Answer:**

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 13
Cluster 2: 3, 5, 7, 15
Cluster 3: 6, 8, 9, 11, 14
