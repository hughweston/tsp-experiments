I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 10: upper left area
- Point 6: upper middle area
- Point 11: upper middle-right area
- Point 3: upper left area (below 10)
- Point 7: middle area
- Point 12: middle-left area
- Point 5: middle area (near 7)
- Point 4: right side
- Point 15: middle-left area (near 12)
- Point 8: right side (below 4)
- Point 14: far left side
- Point 2: lower-left area
- Point 9: middle-right area
- Point 1: lower-middle area
- Point 13: lower-right area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 3, 10, 6, 11 - these are all in the top portion of the image

**Middle-left diagonal cluster:** Points 15, 12, 7, 5 - these form a tight group in the middle-left area

**Right side cluster:** Points 4, 8 - these are close together on the right side

**Lower region cluster:** Points 2, 1, 9, 13 - these are in the lower portion

**Isolated left:** Point 14 - this is on the far left, could group with point 2

Let me refine:

Cluster 1: 3, 10, 6, 11 (upper area)
Cluster 2: 15, 12, 7, 5 (middle diagonal group)
Cluster 3: 4, 8 (right side)
Cluster 4: 14, 2 (left side lower)
Cluster 5: 1, 9, 13 (lower middle-right)

Cluster 1: 3, 6, 10, 11
Cluster 2: 5, 7, 12, 15
Cluster 3: 4, 8
Cluster 4: 2, 14
Cluster 5: 1, 9, 13
