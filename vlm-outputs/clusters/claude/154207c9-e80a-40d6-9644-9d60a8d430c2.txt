I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: right side, upper area
- Point 2: center-left, lower area
- Point 3: left-center, upper area
- Point 4: right-center area
- Point 5: center-right area
- Point 6: center, lower area
- Point 7: right side, middle-lower area
- Point 8: right side, lower-middle area
- Point 9: center, middle area
- Point 10: far left, middle area
- Point 11: far left, upper-middle area
- Point 12: center-upper area
- Point 13: right-upper area
- Point 14: center-left, middle area
- Point 15: left side, lower-middle area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 10, 11, 15 are grouped on the far left side

**Upper-center cluster:** Points 3, 12, 13 are in the upper portion, with 12 and 13 close together and 3 nearby

**Center cluster:** Points 9, 14, 2, 6 form a cluster in the center-left to center area

**Right cluster:** Points 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 are grouped on the right side of the image

Cluster 1: 10, 11, 15
Cluster 2: 3, 12, 13
Cluster 3: 2, 6, 9, 14
Cluster 4: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
