I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 4: top-left area
- Point 1: left side, below point 4
- Point 10: left-center area
- Point 6: left side, below point 10
- Point 8: left side, below point 6
- Point 5: center-bottom area
- Point 9: top-center/right area
- Point 3: top-right area, near point 9
- Point 7: right side, lower area
- Point 2: bottom-right corner

Now I'll identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 4, 1, 10, 6, 8 - these are all on the left side of the image
- Point 4 (top-left)
- Point 1 (upper-left)
- Point 10 (middle-left)
- Point 6 (lower-left)
- Point 8 (lower-left)

**Right cluster:** Points 9, 3, 7, 2 - these are on the right side
- Point 9 (top-right area)
- Point 3 (top-right, near 9)
- Point 7 (right side, middle-lower)
- Point 2 (bottom-right)

**Center point:** Point 5 - this is in the center-bottom, could go with either cluster

Looking more carefully, Point 5 is closer to the left cluster (points 6, 8) than to the right cluster points.

Cluster 1: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10
Cluster 2: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
