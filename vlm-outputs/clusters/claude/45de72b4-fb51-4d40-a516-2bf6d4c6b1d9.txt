I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them by proximity.

Let me map out the approximate positions of each point:

**Upper right area:** 6, 9, 8, 10, 16 (these are clustered together in the top-right)

**Upper middle area:** 7, 20, 14 (clustered in the upper-middle region)

**Middle-left area:** 18, 2, 17, 11, 4 (forming a loose cluster on the left side)

**Lower-left:** 12 (isolated at bottom-left)

**Center area:** 1, 15, 19 (middle of the image)

**Lower-middle/right:** 3, 5, 13 (lower portion, slightly right of center)

Let me refine these clusters based on visual proximity:

**Cluster 1 (Upper right):** Points 6, 8, 9, 10, 16 - tightly grouped in top-right corner

**Cluster 2 (Upper middle):** Points 7, 14, 20 - grouped in upper-middle area

**Cluster 3 (Left side):** Points 2, 4, 11, 12, 17, 18 - spread along the left portion

**Cluster 4 (Center/Lower):** Points 1, 3, 5, 13, 15, 19 - middle to lower-middle area

Cluster 1: 6, 8, 9, 10, 16
Cluster 2: 7, 14, 20
Cluster 3: 2, 4, 11, 12, 17, 18
Cluster 4: 1, 3, 5, 13, 15, 19
