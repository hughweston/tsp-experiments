I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 17, 6, 10, 20: Upper left area
- Point 5: Center-left, upper-middle
- Points 2, 8, 7, 15: Left side, middle to lower
- Points 3, 12: Center-left, lower-middle
- Points 19, 14: Center area
- Point 16: Center-right
- Points 4: Center-lower
- Points 1, 11: Right side, middle
- Points 18, 9, 13: Right side, upper to lower
- Point 17: Top left

Let me group by spatial proximity:

**Upper left cluster:** Points 6, 17, 10, 20 are closely grouped in the upper left corner.

**Left-middle cluster:** Points 2, 8, 7, 15 are on the left side, middle to lower area.

**Center cluster:** Points 5, 3, 12, 19, 14, 4, 16 form a loose central grouping.

**Right cluster:** Points 1, 18, 9, 11, 13 are on the right side of the image.

Let me refine this:

Cluster 1 (Upper left): 6, 17, 10, 20
Cluster 2 (Left side): 2, 8, 7, 15
Cluster 3 (Center): 5, 3, 12, 19, 14, 4, 16
Cluster 4 (Right side): 1, 18, 9, 11, 13

Cluster 1: 6, 17, 10, 20
Cluster 2: 2, 7, 8, 15
Cluster 3: 3, 4, 5, 12, 14, 16, 19
Cluster 4: 1, 9, 11, 13, 18
