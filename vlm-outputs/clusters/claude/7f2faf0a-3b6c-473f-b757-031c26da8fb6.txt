I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 14: far upper left
- Point 18: upper middle area
- Point 10: upper right
- Point 15: right side, upper
- Point 7: right side, upper
- Point 19: middle-right area
- Point 12: right side
- Point 4: center area
- Point 9: center-left area
- Point 11: center area
- Point 17: center-left area
- Point 16: left side
- Point 20: left side
- Point 5: lower-center-left
- Point 1: lower-center
- Point 8: lower-right of center
- Point 2: lower-center
- Point 13: far right
- Point 3: lower-left
- Point 6: lower-center

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper right cluster:** Points 10, 15, 7, 12 - these are grouped together in the upper right area

**Upper left area:** Point 14 - isolated in upper left

**Upper middle:** Point 18 - relatively isolated at top middle

**Center cluster:** Points 4, 9, 11, 17, 19 - these form a diagonal group in the center

**Left side cluster:** Points 16, 20 - on the left side

**Lower cluster:** Points 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 3 - grouped in the lower portion

**Right side:** Point 13 - isolated on far right

Let me reconsider to form more coherent clusters:

- **Upper/Right cluster:** 10, 15, 7, 12, 19, 13 (right side of image)
- **Upper left:** 14, 18 (upper portion, left-center)
- **Center diagonal:** 4, 9, 11, 17 (middle area)
- **Left cluster:** 16, 20, 3 (left side)
- **Lower cluster:** 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 (lower middle)

Cluster 1: 10, 15, 7, 12, 13
Cluster 2: 14, 18
Cluster 3: 4, 9, 11, 17, 19
Cluster 4: 16, 20, 3
Cluster 5: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
