I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 11: far left, upper area
- Point 7: left-center, upper area
- Point 13: upper center
- Point 19: center-upper
- Point 2: center-upper, right of 19
- Point 4: right side, upper
- Point 10: center-left
- Point 15: center
- Point 18: center-right
- Point 14: right of center
- Point 5: center
- Point 6: left side, middle
- Point 3: right side, middle-lower
- Point 1: far left, lower
- Point 12: center, lower
- Point 16: center, lower
- Point 9: left, bottom
- Point 20: left-center, bottom
- Point 17: center-right, bottom
- Point 8: far right, bottom

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 11, 7, 13, 19, 2, 4, 10, 15, 18, 14 - these are in the upper half

**Left side cluster:** Points 11, 7, 6, 1, 9 - these form a left grouping

**Center cluster:** Points 13, 19, 2, 10, 15, 5, 12, 16, 20 - central area

**Right cluster:** Points 4, 14, 18, 3, 8, 17 - right side

Let me refine into clearer spatial clusters:

**Upper-left group:** 11, 7, 13, 10
**Upper-center/right group:** 19, 2, 15, 18, 4, 14
**Middle group:** 5, 6, 3
**Bottom group:** 1, 9, 20, 12, 16, 17, 8

Cluster 1: 11, 7, 13, 19, 2, 10, 15
Cluster 2: 4, 14, 18, 3, 8
Cluster 3: 6, 5, 12, 16
Cluster 4: 1, 9, 20, 17
