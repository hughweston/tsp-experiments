I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: upper right area
- Point 2: right side, middle-lower
- Point 3: upper middle area
- Point 4: upper middle area
- Point 5: upper middle-left area
- Point 6: left side, middle
- Point 7: right side, middle
- Point 8: center-lower area
- Point 9: left side, middle-lower
- Point 10: center-right area
- Point 11: center-right area
- Point 12: left-center area
- Point 13: center-left area
- Point 14: lower-left area
- Point 15: right side, lower

Looking at the spatial distribution, I can identify these clusters:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 3, 4, 5 are close together in the upper portion

**Right side cluster:** Points 1, 7, 2, 15 form a diagonal line on the right side; Points 10, 11 are also in the center-right area

**Left side cluster:** Points 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 are grouped on the left side

**Center cluster:** Point 8 is somewhat central

Let me refine this grouping:

- Upper middle: 3, 4, 5
- Right side: 1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 15
- Left side: 6, 9, 12, 13, 14
- Point 8 is between left and center, closer to the left group

Cluster 1: 3, 4, 5
Cluster 2: 1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 15
Cluster 3: 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14
