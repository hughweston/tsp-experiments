I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Upper right area: 11, 24, 28, 10, 18, 1, 25, 26
- Middle right area: 13, 3, 21, 17
- Center area: 4, 22, 27, 5, 19
- Lower center: 9, 23, 15
- Left side upper: 7, 14
- Left side middle: 8, 29
- Left side lower: 16, 20, 30
- Lower center-left: 2, 12, 6

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Left cluster (left side of image):**
Points 7, 14, 8, 29, 16, 20, 30 - these are all on the left portion

**Lower-center cluster:**
Points 2, 12, 6, 9, 27 - these form a group in the lower-center-left area

**Center-middle cluster:**
Points 4, 22, 5, 23, 15, 19 - these are in the middle area

**Right side cluster:**
Points 13, 10, 3, 21, 17, 28, 24, 11, 18, 1, 25, 26 - these are on the right portion

Let me refine this into clearer spatial groupings:

Cluster 1 (Left side): 7, 14, 8, 29, 16, 20, 30

Cluster 2 (Lower-center-left): 2, 12, 6, 9, 27

Cluster 3 (Center): 4, 22, 5, 23, 15, 19

Cluster 4 (Right side): 13, 10, 3, 21, 17, 28, 24, 11, 18, 1, 25, 26

Cluster 1: 7, 14, 8, 29, 16, 20, 30
Cluster 2: 2, 12, 6, 9, 27
Cluster 3: 4, 22, 5, 23, 15, 19
Cluster 4: 11, 24, 28, 10, 13, 3, 21, 17, 18, 1, 25, 26
