I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them by proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 7, 19, 6: Upper area (7 and 6 on left-center top, 19 on right-center top)
- Points 5, 1: Upper right-center area
- Point 20, 2: Right side, middle-upper area
- Point 12: Right side, middle-lower area
- Points 10, 8: Lower right-center area
- Point 13: Center-right, lower-middle
- Points 3, 11: Center area
- Point 16: Center-left, lower-middle
- Points 14, 17, 4, 18: Left-center area, clustered together
- Points 9, 15: Lower left area

Let me identify natural clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper left region:** Points 7, 6 (close together vertically)

**Upper center-right region:** Points 19, 5, 1 (relatively close)

**Right side region:** Points 20, 2, 12 (forming a vertical line on the right)

**Lower right region:** Points 8, 10, 13 (clustered in lower right)

**Center region:** Points 3, 11, 16 (middle area)

**Left cluster:** Points 14, 17, 4, 18, 9, 15 (left side, fairly clustered)

Let me refine this into clearer clusters:

Cluster 1: 6, 7 (upper left)
Cluster 2: 19, 5, 1 (upper middle-right)
Cluster 3: 20, 2, 12 (right edge)
Cluster 4: 8, 10, 13 (lower right)
Cluster 5: 3, 11, 16 (center)
Cluster 6: 9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 4 (left side cluster)

Cluster 1: 6, 7
Cluster 2: 19, 5, 1
Cluster 3: 20, 2, 12
Cluster 4: 8, 10, 13
Cluster 5: 3, 11, 16
Cluster 6: 4, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18
