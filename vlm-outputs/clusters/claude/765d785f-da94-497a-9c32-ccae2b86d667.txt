I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: upper right area
- Point 2: center-right area
- Point 3: center-left area
- Point 4: upper left area
- Point 5: left side, middle height
- Point 6: center-left, below point 3
- Point 7: right side, lower area
- Point 8: center, middle height
- Point 9: right side, upper area
- Point 10: right side, lower area
- Point 11: right side, lower-middle area
- Point 12: far left, lower area
- Point 13: center, lower area
- Point 14: left side, middle height
- Point 15: left side, lower area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 1, 4 (both in the upper portion)

**Left side cluster:** Points 5, 14, 12, 15 (all on the left side, relatively close together)

**Center-left cluster:** Points 3, 6, 13 (center to center-left, middle to lower)

**Center-right cluster:** Points 8, 2 (center area)

**Right side cluster:** Points 9, 7, 10, 11 (right side of the image)

Let me refine this into cleaner groupings:

**Cluster 1 (Upper area):** 1, 4, 9 - points in the upper portion

**Cluster 2 (Left side):** 5, 14, 12, 15 - points on the far left

**Cluster 3 (Center):** 3, 6, 8, 13, 2 - central points

**Cluster 4 (Right-lower):** 7, 10, 11 - right side lower points

Cluster 1: 1, 4, 9
Cluster 2: 5, 12, 14, 15
Cluster 3: 3, 6, 8, 13, 2
Cluster 4: 7, 10, 11
