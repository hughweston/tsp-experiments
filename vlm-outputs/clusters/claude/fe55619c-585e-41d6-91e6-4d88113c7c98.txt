I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 8: upper left area
- Point 16: upper middle
- Point 4: upper right
- Point 19: upper middle area
- Point 18: left side, upper
- Point 12: middle right area
- Point 9: left side
- Point 3: right side
- Point 17: left-center area
- Point 1: center
- Point 6: far right
- Point 10: far left, lower
- Point 11: center-left, lower
- Point 13: center-right
- Point 20: right side, lower
- Point 5: left side, lower
- Point 15: lower left-center
- Point 2: lower center
- Point 7: lower center-right
- Point 14: lower right

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 8, 16, 4, 19 are in the top portion

**Left side cluster:** Points 18, 9, 10, 17, 5 are on the left side

**Center cluster:** Points 1, 11, 15, 2 are in the center-lower area

**Right side cluster:** Points 12, 3, 6, 13, 20, 14, 7 are on the right side

Let me refine this based on closer examination:

Cluster 1 (Upper area): 8, 16, 4, 19, 12
Cluster 2 (Left side): 18, 9, 10, 17, 5
Cluster 3 (Center-lower): 1, 11, 15, 2
Cluster 4 (Right side): 3, 6, 13, 20, 14, 7

Cluster 1: 8, 16, 4, 19, 12
Cluster 2: 18, 9, 10, 17, 5
Cluster 3: 1, 11, 15, 2
Cluster 4: 3, 6, 13, 20, 14, 7
