I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top right area: 1, 9, 16, 2
- Top area: 22, 25
- Upper middle: 6, 3, 11
- Middle right: 7, 12
- Middle area: 19, 8, 17, 18, 21
- Left side: 23, 13, 24, 15
- Lower middle: 14, 5, 10, 4, 20

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Upper right cluster:** Points 1, 9, 16, 2 are clustered in the upper right area

**Top left area:** Point 22 is isolated at top left, point 6 is below it, and 23 is to the left middle - these form a left-upper group with 22, 6, 23, 19

**Middle-right cluster:** Points 7, 11, 8, 12, 21 are in the middle-right region

**Center cluster:** Points 3, 17, 18, 14 are in the central area

**Lower cluster:** Points 5, 4, 10, 20 are in the lower middle area

**Left side cluster:** Points 13, 24, 15 are on the left side

**Top:** Point 25 is at the top center

Let me refine into clearer clusters:

**Cluster 1 (Upper right):** 1, 9, 16, 2

**Cluster 2 (Top/upper left):** 22, 6, 25, 3

**Cluster 3 (Left side):** 23, 13, 24, 15, 19

**Cluster 4 (Center):** 18, 17, 14, 8, 11

**Cluster 5 (Lower middle):** 5, 4, 10, 20, 21

**Cluster 6 (Middle right):** 7, 12

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 9, 16
Cluster 2: 22, 6, 25, 3
Cluster 3: 23, 13, 24, 15, 19
Cluster 4: 11, 8, 17, 18, 14
Cluster 5: 5, 4, 10, 20, 21
Cluster 6: 7, 12
