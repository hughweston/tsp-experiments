I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top left area: 10, 19
- Upper middle-left: 2, 5, 17, 22
- Upper right: 6, 11
- Middle left: 4, 7, 16
- Middle center: 23, 24, 20, 21, 12
- Middle-right area: 8, 15, 3, 14
- Lower left: 25, 1
- Lower middle-right: 18, 9, 13

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Top-left region:** Points 10, 19, 7, 4 - these are on the left edge

**Upper-middle region:** Points 2, 5, 17, 22, 16 - these form a cluster in the upper-middle-left area

**Upper-right region:** Points 6, 11, 8, 15, 3 - these are along the right side, upper to middle

**Center region:** Points 23, 24, 20, 21, 12, 14, 18 - these form a central band

**Lower region:** Points 25, 1, 9, 13 - these are in the lower portion

Let me reconsider to make cleaner clusters based on visual proximity:

**Left side cluster (descending left edge):** 10, 4, 7, 19

**Upper middle cluster:** 2, 5, 17, 22, 16

**Right side cluster:** 6, 11, 8, 15, 3

**Center-bottom cluster:** 23, 24, 21, 12, 20, 14, 18

**Bottom cluster:** 25, 1, 9, 13

Cluster 1: 10, 4, 7, 19
Cluster 2: 2, 5, 17, 22, 16
Cluster 3: 6, 11, 8, 15, 3
Cluster 4: 21, 23, 24, 12, 20, 14, 18
Cluster 5: 25, 1, 9, 13
