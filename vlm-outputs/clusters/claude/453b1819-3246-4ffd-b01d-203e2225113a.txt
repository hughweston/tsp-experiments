I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me map out the approximate positions of each point:

**Upper region:**
- 23, 15 (top center)
- 17, 3 (top right)
- 14 (upper middle)

**Left side:**
- 16, 21 (upper left)
- 20, 7 (middle left)
- 11 (lower left)
- 1 (lower left)

**Center region:**
- 9, 5 (middle center-left)
- 25, 22 (middle center)
- 19, 12 (middle center)
- 8 (lower center)

**Right side:**
- 13, 18 (right side)
- 4, 24 (middle right)
- 6, 10 (lower right)
- 2 (lower center-right)

Let me identify natural clusters:

**Cluster 1 - Left side group:** Points 16, 21, 20, 7, 11, 1
These form a vertical chain on the left side of the image.

**Cluster 2 - Center group:** Points 9, 5, 25, 22, 19, 12, 8
These are clustered in the central area.

**Cluster 3 - Top/Upper right group:** Points 23, 15, 14, 3, 17
These are in the upper portion of the image.

**Cluster 4 - Right side group:** Points 4, 13, 18, 24, 6, 10, 2
These form a group on the right side extending downward.

Cluster 1: 16, 21, 20, 7, 11, 1
Cluster 2: 9, 5, 25, 22, 19, 12, 8
Cluster 3: 23, 15, 14, 3, 17
Cluster 4: 4, 13, 18, 24, 6, 10, 2
