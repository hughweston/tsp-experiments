I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 21, 25, 3 are in the upper left area
- Point 20, 12 are in the upper right area
- Point 1 is on the far left, middle height
- Point 4 is left-center area
- Points 2, 19, 16 are in the center-left region
- Point 17 is in the middle-lower area
- Points 7, 13, 18 are in the lower-center area
- Point 6, 8 are in the upper-center-right area
- Points 15, 5, 10 are in the right-center area
- Point 22 is in the center area
- Points 9, 24, 14 are in the lower-right-center area
- Points 11, 23 are on the far right side

Looking at the spatial distribution, I can see roughly three clusters:

1. **Upper-left cluster**: Points 21, 25, 3, 1, 4 (the leftmost points forming an upper-left grouping)

2. **Center diagonal cluster**: Points 2, 19, 16, 17, 13, 7, 18, 22 (forming a diagonal line through the center)

3. **Right side cluster**: Points 20, 12, 6, 8, 15, 5, 10, 24, 9, 14, 11, 23 (the points on the right side of the image)

Let me refine this based on closer inspection of proximities:

Cluster 1: 1, 4, 21, 3, 25 (upper-left region)

Cluster 2: 2, 19, 16, 17, 13, 7, 18, 22 (central diagonal band)

Cluster 3: 6, 8, 15, 5, 10, 20, 12, 24, 9, 14, 11, 23 (right side region)

**Cluster 1:** 1, 3, 4, 21, 25
**Cluster 2:** 2, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22
**Cluster 3:** 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20, 23, 24
