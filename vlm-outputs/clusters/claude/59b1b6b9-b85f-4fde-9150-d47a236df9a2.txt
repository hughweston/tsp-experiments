I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: middle center area
- Point 2: upper right area
- Point 3: left-center area
- Point 4: upper middle area
- Point 5: lower center area
- Point 6: middle left-center area
- Point 7: lower left area
- Point 8: top right corner
- Point 9: right side, middle-lower area
- Point 10: left side, upper area

Now let me group them by spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 4, 2, and 8 are in the upper portion of the image. Point 8 is at the top right corner, Point 4 is upper middle, and Point 2 is upper right.

**Left-center cluster:** Points 10, 3, and 6 are positioned on the left side of the image in a relatively close vertical arrangement.

**Center cluster:** Points 1 is in the middle center area.

**Lower cluster:** Points 5 and 7 are in the lower portion, relatively close to each other.

**Right side:** Point 9 is on the right side, somewhat isolated.

Let me reconsider to form more coherent clusters:

- Points 3, 6, 1 are close together in the center-left area
- Points 4, 2 are in the upper middle-right area
- Point 8 is isolated at top right
- Points 5, 7 are in the lower left area
- Point 9 is on the right side
- Point 10 is on the upper left

Grouping by proximity:

Cluster 1: 3, 6, 1, 10 (left-center region)
Cluster 2: 4, 2, 8 (upper right region)
Cluster 3: 5, 7 (lower left region)
Cluster 4: 9 (right side, could join with nearby points)

Let me simplify to clearer clusters:

Cluster 1: 10, 3, 6, 7 (left side)
Cluster 2: 4, 2, 8 (upper area)
Cluster 3: 1, 5, 9 (center to right, lower-middle area)
