I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first map out the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 4: upper left
- Point 5: upper left area, right of 4
- Point 8: left side, below 4
- Point 7: left-center area
- Point 9: upper center
- Point 10: upper right
- Point 13: right side, upper
- Point 6: center-right area
- Point 11: center
- Point 1: center, right of 11
- Point 15: left-center, below 7
- Point 2: center-right, lower
- Point 3: right side, lower
- Point 14: center-lower
- Point 12: lower left

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper left region:** Points 4, 5, 8, 7 are grouped together in the left portion of the image

**Upper right region:** Points 9, 10, 13, 6 are in the upper-right area

**Center region:** Points 11, 1, 15 are in the middle area

**Lower region:** Points 14, 2, 3, 12 are in the lower portion

Let me refine this grouping:

- Points 4, 5, 8, 7 form a left-side cluster
- Points 10, 13, 9, 6 form an upper-right cluster
- Points 11, 1, 15 are in the center
- Points 12, 14, 2, 3 are in the lower portion

Cluster 1: 4, 5, 8, 7
Cluster 2: 9, 10, 13, 6
Cluster 3: 11, 1, 15
Cluster 4: 12, 14, 2, 3
