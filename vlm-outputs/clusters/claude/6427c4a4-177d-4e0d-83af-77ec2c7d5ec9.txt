I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 20: upper left area
- Point 13: upper middle area
- Point 6: upper middle-right area
- Point 14: upper right corner
- Point 19: right side, upper
- Point 4: right side
- Point 18: right side
- Point 15: right side
- Point 17: right side, middle
- Point 3: middle-right area
- Point 2: middle area
- Point 7: middle area
- Point 5: middle-left area
- Point 1: middle area
- Point 11: middle-left area
- Point 8: left side
- Point 10: left-middle area
- Point 12: lower-left area
- Point 9: lower-middle area
- Point 16: lower-middle area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Right side cluster**: Points 14, 19, 4, 18, 15, 17, 3 - these form a vertical chain on the right side

**Upper-middle cluster**: Points 20, 13, 6 - these are in the upper portion, left-center area

**Center cluster**: Points 5, 7, 2, 1, 11 - these are grouped in the middle of the image

**Left-lower cluster**: Points 8, 10, 12, 9, 16 - these are on the left and lower portion

Cluster 1: 14, 19, 4, 18, 15, 17, 3
Cluster 2: 20, 13, 6
Cluster 3: 5, 7, 2, 1, 11
Cluster 4: 8, 10, 12, 9, 16
