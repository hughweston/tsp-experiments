I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top area: 25, 11, 10, 17
- Upper-middle area: 12, 4, 1
- Left side: 22, 5, 23, 24, 15, 9
- Middle area: 19, 21, 8, 18, 13, 2, 3
- Right side: 20, 6, 16, 14
- Lower middle: 7

Let me identify natural clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster**: Points 22, 5, 23, 24, 9, 15, 18 - these are grouped on the left side of the image

**Upper/center cluster**: Points 25, 12, 4, 10, 1, 19, 21 - these form a group in the upper-middle region

**Right cluster**: Points 11, 17, 20, 6, 14, 16, 3 - these are on the right side

**Lower-middle cluster**: Points 8, 13, 2, 7 - these are in the lower-center area

Let me refine this grouping:

Looking more carefully at proximity:
- Far left: 22, 23, 24, 15, 5, 9
- Center-left: 18, 8, 19, 21, 12
- Upper center-right: 25, 4, 10, 1, 17, 11
- Lower center: 13, 2, 7, 3
- Far right: 20, 6, 16, 14

Cluster 1: 22, 23, 24, 15, 5, 9
Cluster 2: 18, 19, 21, 8, 12
Cluster 3: 25, 4, 10, 1, 11, 17
Cluster 4: 13, 2, 7, 3, 16
Cluster 5: 20, 6, 14
