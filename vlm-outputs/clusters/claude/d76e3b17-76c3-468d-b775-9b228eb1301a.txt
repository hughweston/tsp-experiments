I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 8: upper left area
- Point 11: upper right area
- Point 15: left side, middle-upper
- Point 14: center-upper area
- Point 9: right side, upper-middle
- Point 4: left-center area
- Point 7: right side, middle
- Point 1: far right, middle
- Point 2: right side, middle
- Point 13: right-center area
- Point 10: center-right, lower-middle
- Point 6: left-center, lower area
- Point 3: center-left, lower area
- Point 12: right side, lower area
- Point 5: center-bottom area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left/Upper-Left region:** Points 8, 15, 4, 14 are in the upper-left to center-left area

**Right/Upper-Right region:** Points 11, 9, 1, 7, 2, 13 are clustered on the right side

**Lower region:** Points 6, 3, 5, 10, 12 are in the lower portion of the image

Let me refine this:
- Points 8, 15 are in the upper left
- Points 4, 14 are nearby in the center-left upper area
- Points 11, 9, 1, 7, 2, 13 form a cluster on the right side
- Points 6, 3, 5 are in the lower-left/center-bottom
- Points 10, 12 are in the lower-right area

Grouping into 3 main clusters:

Cluster 1: 8, 15, 4, 14 (left side, upper region)
Cluster 2: 11, 9, 1, 7, 2, 13, 10, 12 (right side)
Cluster 3: 6, 3, 5 (bottom-left/center region)

Cluster 1: 8, 15, 4, 14
Cluster 2: 11, 9, 1, 7, 2, 13, 10, 12
Cluster 3: 6, 3, 5
