I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

Upper region (top area):
- Points 26, 23, 8 are in the upper-left area
- Points 28, 1, 21, 2 are in the upper-right area
- Point 25 is on the far left upper area

Middle-left region:
- Points 30, 6, 7 are on the left side
- Points 20, 5, 22 are in the middle area
- Points 4, 17, 13 are in the middle-right area
- Points 9, 11 are on the right side

Lower region:
- Points 27, 29, 24 are in the lower-left area
- Points 16, 10, 12 are in the lower-middle-left area
- Points 3, 14, 18 are in the lower-middle area
- Points 19, 15 are in the lower-right area

Let me group by spatial clusters:

**Upper-left cluster:** 25, 26, 23, 8, 6, 7, 30

**Upper-right cluster:** 28, 1, 21, 2, 13, 17, 4

**Middle cluster:** 22, 20, 5, 9, 11

**Lower-left cluster:** 27, 29, 24, 16, 10

**Lower-middle/right cluster:** 12, 3, 14, 18, 19, 15

Cluster 1: 25, 26, 23, 8, 6, 7, 30
Cluster 2: 28, 1, 21, 2, 13
Cluster 3: 22, 20, 5, 4, 17, 9, 11
Cluster 4: 27, 29, 24, 16, 10
Cluster 5: 12, 3, 14, 18, 19, 15
