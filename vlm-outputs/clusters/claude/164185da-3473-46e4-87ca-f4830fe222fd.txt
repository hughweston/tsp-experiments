I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 14: upper left area
- Point 6: left side, upper
- Point 11: upper right
- Point 4: right side, upper-middle
- Point 16: center-upper
- Point 13: center-upper
- Point 20: center-right area
- Point 10: far left, middle
- Point 18: left-center
- Point 17: left side, middle-lower
- Point 19: left side, lower
- Point 9: center
- Point 8: center
- Point 7: right side, middle
- Point 3: center-right, middle-lower
- Point 1: right side, lower-middle
- Point 5: center-left, lower
- Point 12: center, lower
- Point 15: center, lower
- Point 2: right side, lower

Let me identify natural clusters:

**Left cluster:** Points 6, 10, 17, 18, 19 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Upper/center cluster:** Points 14, 13, 16, 11, 4, 20 - these are in the upper portion

**Right-middle cluster:** Points 7, 1, 2, 3 - these are on the right side, middle to lower

**Center-lower cluster:** Points 8, 9, 5, 12, 15 - these are in the center-lower area

Let me refine this:

Cluster 1 (Left side): 6, 10, 17, 18, 19
Cluster 2 (Upper region): 14, 11, 4, 16, 13, 20
Cluster 3 (Center): 8, 9, 5, 12, 15
Cluster 4 (Right side): 7, 1, 2, 3

Cluster 1: 6, 10, 17, 18, 19
Cluster 2: 11, 14, 4, 16, 13, 20
Cluster 3: 8, 9, 5, 12, 15
Cluster 4: 1, 2, 3, 7
