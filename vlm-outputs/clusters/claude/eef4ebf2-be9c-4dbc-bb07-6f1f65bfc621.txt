I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 17: top center
- Point 5: upper left area
- Point 11: upper right area
- Point 13: right side, upper
- Point 15: upper middle-right
- Point 4: left side
- Point 9: left-center area
- Point 3: center
- Point 14: right side
- Point 16: far right
- Point 20: center
- Point 18: left side, lower
- Point 12: center-left
- Point 1: right-center
- Point 8: center
- Point 2: bottom left
- Point 7: bottom left area
- Point 10: center-bottom
- Point 6: bottom center
- Point 19: bottom right

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 2, 4, 7, 9, 18 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Center cluster:** Points 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 - these form a central grouping

**Upper area cluster:** Points 5, 11, 15, 17 - these are in the upper portion

**Right cluster:** Points 1, 13, 14, 16, 19 - these are on the right side of the image

Cluster 1: 2, 4, 7, 9, 18
Cluster 2: 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20
Cluster 3: 5, 11, 15, 17
Cluster 4: 1, 13, 14, 16, 19
