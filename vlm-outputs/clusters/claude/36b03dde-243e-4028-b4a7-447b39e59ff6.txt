I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 7: upper left area
- Point 3: upper middle area
- Point 1: upper middle area (slightly left of 3)
- Point 2: upper middle-right area
- Point 8: left side, middle height
- Point 9: center of image
- Point 10: right side, lower middle
- Point 6: bottom left
- Point 4: lower middle-left
- Point 5: bottom right

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 7, 1, 3, 2 are all relatively close together in the upper portion of the image.

**Left side cluster:** Point 8 is somewhat isolated on the left, and Point 6 is in the bottom left. These are on the left side but fairly spread out.

**Center-lower region:** Points 9 and 4 are in the middle/lower-middle area.

**Right-lower region:** Points 10 and 5 are on the right side, lower portion.

Let me reconsider the groupings:
- Points 1, 2, 3, 7 form a tight cluster at the top
- Points 8, 6 are on the left side
- Points 4, 9 are in the central area
- Points 5, 10 are on the right side

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 3, 7
Cluster 2: 6, 8
Cluster 3: 4, 9
Cluster 4: 5, 10
