I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on their proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

**Upper left region:** 23, 16, 27, 30, 10, 22, 19, 15, 14, 20, 3, 13

**Middle region:** 28, 2, 9, 18

**Lower left region:** 6, 12, 8

**Right side/lower right region:** 5, 21, 11, 7, 25, 29, 1, 24, 4, 26, 17

Let me refine these clusters by looking more carefully at the spatial distribution:

**Top-left cluster (upper portion):** Points 23, 16, 27, 30, 10, 22, 19, 15, 14, 20, 3, 13 - these are all in the upper-left quadrant

**Middle-right cluster:** Points 2, 28, 18, 9 - these form a loose group in the middle area

**Lower-left cluster:** Points 6, 12, 8 - isolated in the lower-left

**Right/lower-right cluster:** Points 5, 21, 11, 7, 25, 29, 1, 24, 4, 26, 17 - these are grouped in the right and lower-right portion

Let me consolidate into clearer clusters:

Cluster 1: **Upper-left group** - 23, 16, 27, 30, 10, 22, 19, 15, 14, 20, 3, 13

Cluster 2: **Lower-left group** - 6, 12, 8

Cluster 3: **Middle to upper-middle** - 2, 28, 9, 18

Cluster 4: **Right/lower-right group** - 5, 21, 11, 7, 25, 29, 1, 24, 4, 26, 17

**Final Answer:**

Cluster 1: 23, 16, 27, 30, 10, 22, 19, 15, 14, 20, 3, 13
Cluster 2: 6, 12, 8
Cluster 3: 2, 28, 9, 18
Cluster 4: 5, 21, 11, 7, 25, 29, 1, 24, 4, 26, 17
