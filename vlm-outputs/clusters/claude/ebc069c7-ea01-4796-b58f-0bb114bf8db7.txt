I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top area: 3 (far left), 16 (center-top), 12 (far right)
- Upper-left region: 20, 14, 17
- Center-left region: 1, 6, 25, 23, 15
- Lower-left region: 10, 8, 2
- Center region: 13, 21, 11
- Center-right region: 19, 22
- Right region: 5, 24, 4, 9, 7, 18
- Bottom-right area: 7, 18

Let me group by spatial proximity:

**Left side cluster (lower-left):** Points 10, 8, 2, 17 - these are in the lower-left area

**Upper-left cluster:** Points 3, 20, 14 - upper left region

**Center-left cluster:** Points 1, 6, 25, 23, 15, 21, 13 - middle left to center area

**Center cluster:** Points 11, 22, 19, 16 - center to upper-center area

**Right cluster:** Points 12, 5, 24, 4, 9, 7, 18 - right side of the image

Let me refine this into clearer clusters:

Cluster 1 (Left side): 3, 20, 14, 17, 10, 8 - leftmost points
Cluster 2 (Center-left): 1, 6, 25, 23, 2, 15, 13, 21, 11 - center-left region
Cluster 3 (Center-upper): 16, 19, 22 - upper center
Cluster 4 (Right side): 12, 5, 24, 4, 9, 7, 18 - right side points

Cluster 1: 3, 20, 14, 17, 10, 8
Cluster 2: 1, 6, 25, 23, 2, 15, 13, 21, 11
Cluster 3: 16, 19, 22
Cluster 4: 12, 5, 24, 4, 9, 7, 18
