I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: middle area, upper-center
- Point 2: lower-left area
- Point 3: far left, middle-low
- Point 4: left side, upper area
- Point 5: right side, middle
- Point 6: upper-center
- Point 7: center, slightly below point 1
- Point 8: left side, below point 4
- Point 9: right-center, lower area
- Point 10: far right, middle

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 3, 8, 4, 2 - these are all on the left side of the image
- Point 3: far left, middle-low
- Point 4: left, upper
- Point 8: left, below 4
- Point 2: lower-left

**Center cluster:** Points 1, 6, 7 - these are grouped in the center-upper area
- Point 6: upper-center
- Point 1: center
- Point 7: center, below 1

**Right cluster:** Points 5, 9, 10 - these are on the right side
- Point 5: right side
- Point 9: right-center, lower
- Point 10: far right

Cluster 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
Cluster 2: 1, 6, 7
Cluster 3: 5, 9, 10
