I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: left side, middle height
- Point 2: right side, middle-lower area
- Point 3: right-center, lower area
- Point 4: upper-center area
- Point 5: center-left, lower area
- Point 6: right-center, upper-middle area
- Point 7: far right, upper area
- Point 8: center, middle-lower area
- Point 9: far left, middle area
- Point 10: center, upper-middle area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 9 and 1 are close together on the left side of the image.

**Upper-right cluster:** Points 4, 10, 6, and 7 are in the upper portion of the image, forming a diagonal grouping from center-top to upper-right.

**Lower-center/right cluster:** Points 5, 8, 3, and 2 are in the lower-middle to lower-right portion of the image.

Let me verify these groupings make sense spatially:
- 9 and 1: both on the left, relatively close
- 4, 10, 6, 7: upper region, 4 and 10 are near each other, 6 and 7 are to the right
- 5, 8, 3, 2: lower region, 5 and 8 are near center-bottom, 3 and 2 are to the right

Cluster 1: 9, 1
Cluster 2: 4, 10, 6, 7
Cluster 3: 5, 8, 3, 2
