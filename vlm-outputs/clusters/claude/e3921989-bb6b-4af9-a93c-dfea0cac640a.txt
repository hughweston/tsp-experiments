I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 17, 3, 15: Upper left area
- Point 5: Upper middle-left
- Points 8, 19, 11: Upper middle area
- Point 7: Upper right
- Points 14, 1: Middle right area
- Point 10: Right side, middle
- Points 12, 13: Left side, lower middle
- Points 2, 20, 16: Lower middle area
- Points 18, 6, 4, 9: Lower right area

Now let me group them by spatial proximity:

**Upper left cluster:** Points 17, 3, 15, 5 - these are clustered in the upper left region

**Upper middle cluster:** Points 8, 19, 11, 1, 14 - these form a group in the upper-middle to middle-right area

**Upper right cluster:** Point 7 is somewhat isolated but closer to 14 and 10

**Lower left cluster:** Points 12, 13 - isolated on the left side

**Lower middle cluster:** Points 2, 20, 16 - grouped in the lower middle

**Lower right cluster:** Points 18, 6, 4, 9, 10 - form a diagonal line in the lower right

Let me refine these into cleaner clusters:

Cluster 1: 17, 3, 15, 5 (upper left region)
Cluster 2: 8, 19, 11, 1, 14, 7 (upper middle to upper right)
Cluster 3: 12, 13 (left side, lower)
Cluster 4: 2, 20, 16 (lower middle)
Cluster 5: 18, 6, 4, 9, 10 (lower right diagonal)

**Cluster 1:** 3, 5, 15, 17
**Cluster 2:** 1, 7, 8, 11, 14, 19
**Cluster 3:** 12, 13
**Cluster 4:** 2, 16, 20
**Cluster 5:** 4, 6, 9, 10, 18
