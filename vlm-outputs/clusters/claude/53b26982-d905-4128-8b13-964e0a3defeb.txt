I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: upper-left area
- Point 2: middle-center area
- Point 3: far right, lower area
- Point 4: left-center area
- Point 5: far right, lower area (near 3)
- Point 6: upper-left area
- Point 7: left side, middle-lower area
- Point 8: center-right, upper-middle area
- Point 9: upper-center area
- Point 10: upper-left area (near 1)
- Point 11: upper-center area (near 9)
- Point 12: far upper-right
- Point 13: far left, middle area
- Point 14: right side, middle-lower area
- Point 15: center-right, lower-middle area

Looking at the spatial distribution, I can identify these clusters:

**Upper-left cluster**: Points 1, 6, 10, 11 are closely grouped in the upper-left region

**Upper-center/right cluster**: Points 9, 8, 12 are in the upper portion, with 9 and 11 close but 12 is more isolated upper-right

**Left-middle cluster**: Points 4, 7, 13 are on the left side in the middle region

**Center cluster**: Point 2, 15 are in the middle-center area

**Right-lower cluster**: Points 3, 5, 14 are on the right side in the lower portion

Let me refine this grouping:

Cluster 1: 1, 6, 10, 11, 9 (upper-left to upper-center group)
Cluster 2: 4, 7, 13 (left-middle group)
Cluster 3: 8, 12 (upper-right area)
Cluster 4: 2, 15 (center-lower area)
Cluster 5: 3, 5, 14 (right-lower area)

Cluster 1: 1, 6, 9, 10, 11
Cluster 2: 4, 7, 13
Cluster 3: 8, 12
Cluster 4: 2, 14, 15
Cluster 5: 3, 5
