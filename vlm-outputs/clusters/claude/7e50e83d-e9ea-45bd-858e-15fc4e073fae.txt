I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: bottom-left area
- Point 2: upper-middle-right area
- Point 3: upper-middle-left area
- Point 4: upper-right area
- Point 5: middle-right area
- Point 6: top-right corner
- Point 7: middle area
- Point 8: lower-middle area
- Point 9: middle-left area
- Point 10: top-left area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper-left region:** Points 10, 3, 9 are relatively close to each other in the upper-left to middle-left area.

**Upper-right region:** Points 4, 6, 2 are in the upper-right portion of the image, fairly close together.

**Middle region:** Point 7 is in the center area.

**Lower region:** Points 1, 8 are in the lower portion.

**Right-middle:** Point 5 is somewhat isolated on the right side.

Let me reconsider the groupings by looking at closer proximities:

- Points 3, 9, 10 form a cluster in the upper-left/middle-left
- Points 2, 4, 6, 7 are in the upper-right to middle area
- Points 1, 8 are in the lower portion
- Point 5 is on the right side, closer to points 7, 8, or 2

Looking more carefully:
- Cluster in upper-left: 10, 3, 9
- Cluster in upper-right: 4, 6, 2
- Cluster in middle-lower: 7, 5, 8
- Point 1 is isolated at bottom-left, closest to 8

Cluster 1: 10, 3, 9
Cluster 2: 4, 6, 2
Cluster 3: 1, 8, 7, 5
