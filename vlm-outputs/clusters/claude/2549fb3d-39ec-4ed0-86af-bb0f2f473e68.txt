I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 6: upper area, left-center
- Point 9: upper right area
- Point 5: upper right, below 9
- Point 2: middle left area
- Point 12: center area
- Point 8: right side, middle
- Point 15: left edge, middle-lower
- Point 4: left edge, below 15
- Point 7: left side, near 4 and 15
- Point 1: right side, lower-middle
- Point 13: center, lower-middle
- Point 11: center-right, lower-middle
- Point 10: lower left
- Point 3: lower center
- Point 14: lower right

Now let me group by spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 15, 4, 7, 10 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Upper right cluster:** Points 9, 5, 6 - these are in the upper portion

**Center/Right middle cluster:** Points 2, 12, 8, 1 - these form a roughly middle band

**Lower center cluster:** Points 13, 11, 3, 14 - these are in the lower portion

Let me refine this based on closer examination:

- Points 4, 15, 7 are very close together on the left
- Point 10 is lower left, somewhat isolated
- Points 6, 9, 5 are in the upper region
- Points 2, 12 are in the middle
- Points 8, 1 are on the right middle
- Points 13, 11, 3, 14 are in the lower region

Cluster 1: 4, 15, 7, 10
Cluster 2: 6, 9, 5
Cluster 3: 2, 12, 13, 3
Cluster 4: 8, 1, 11, 14
