I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: lower-left area, middle height
- Point 2: far left, lower area
- Point 3: right side, lower area
- Point 4: right side, middle-right area
- Point 5: center-right, lower-middle area
- Point 6: upper-left area
- Point 7: upper-left area (near point 6)
- Point 8: center, middle area
- Point 9: center-right, upper-middle area
- Point 10: far right, lower area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper-left cluster:** Points 6 and 7 are very close together in the upper-left region.

**Lower-left cluster:** Points 1 and 2 are in the left side, lower portion of the image.

**Center-right cluster:** Points 8, 9, 5, 3, 4, and 10 are spread across the right and center portions of the image. Looking more carefully:
- Points 8 and 9 are relatively close in the center
- Points 3, 5, 4, and 10 form a group in the lower-right area

Let me refine this into clearer clusters:

**Cluster 1 (Upper-left):** 6, 7 - these are very close together

**Cluster 2 (Lower-left):** 1, 2 - both on the left side, lower region

**Cluster 3 (Right/center region):** 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 - these points are distributed across the center to right side of the image

Cluster 1: 6, 7
Cluster 2: 1, 2
Cluster 3: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10
