I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 5, 18, 6: Upper left area
- Points 10, 4, 15: Upper middle area
- Point 16: Upper right-middle area
- Points 1, 13, 17: Center-right area
- Points 2, 3, 11: Center-left area
- Point 14: Right side
- Points 12, 19: Left side, lower
- Point 7: Center
- Point 20: Lower center-left
- Points 8, 9: Lower right

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Upper left region:** 5, 6, 18 (clustered together in upper left)

**Upper middle region:** 10, 15, 4 (clustered near top center)

**Center-left region:** 2, 3, 11, 12, 19, 20 (forming a diagonal line on the left side)

**Center-right region:** 1, 13, 16, 17, 7 (middle area points)

**Right side:** 14, 8, 9 (right side of image)

Let me reconsider to make cleaner clusters:

Looking more carefully at the spatial distribution:
- Upper area: 5, 18, 6, 10, 15, 4, 16
- Middle diagonal: 2, 3, 11, 1, 13, 17, 7
- Lower/edges: 12, 19, 20, 14, 8, 9

Cluster 1: 5, 6, 18, 10, 15, 4
Cluster 2: 16, 1, 13, 17, 14
Cluster 3: 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 19, 20
Cluster 4: 8, 9
