I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: middle-left area
- Point 2: slightly above and right of point 1
- Point 3: lower-left area
- Point 4: lower-left area (left of point 3)
- Point 5: right side, middle-low
- Point 6: upper-right area
- Point 7: right side, middle
- Point 8: upper-right (highest point)
- Point 9: center area
- Point 10: center area (below point 9)

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper-right cluster:** Points 6, 7, 8 are all on the right side of the image, with 6 and 8 in the upper portion and 7 slightly lower but still on the right.

**Lower-left cluster:** Points 3 and 4 are close together in the lower-left corner.

**Center-left cluster:** Points 1 and 2 are close together in the middle-left area.

**Center cluster:** Points 9 and 10 are near each other in the center of the image.

**Right-middle cluster:** Point 5 is on the right side, somewhat isolated but could group with 7.

Let me reconsider for cleaner groupings:
- Points 1, 2, 9, 10 form a central cluster
- Points 3, 4 are in the lower-left
- Points 5, 6, 7, 8 are on the right side

Cluster 1: 1, 2, 9, 10
Cluster 2: 3, 4
Cluster 3: 5, 6, 7, 8
