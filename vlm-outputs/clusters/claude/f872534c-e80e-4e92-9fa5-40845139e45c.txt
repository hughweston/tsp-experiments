I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 1: far right, middle-lower area
- Point 2: left side, middle area
- Point 3: upper right area
- Point 4: center-left, lower area
- Point 5: upper center area
- Point 6: center-right, lower area
- Point 7: far left, upper area
- Point 8: right side, upper-middle area
- Point 9: center-right, upper-middle area
- Point 10: center-left, upper area
- Point 11: center, middle area
- Point 12: right side, middle area
- Point 13: center, upper area
- Point 14: center, lower area
- Point 15: far right, upper area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper left region:** Points 7, 2, 10 are in the left portion
**Upper center region:** Points 5, 13, 9 are clustered together in the upper-center
**Upper right region:** Points 3, 8, 15 are in the upper-right area
**Right-middle/lower region:** Points 1, 12, 6 are close together on the right side
**Center-lower region:** Points 4, 11, 14 are in the center-lower area

Let me refine these clusters:

Cluster 1 (Left side): 7, 2, 10
Cluster 2 (Upper center): 5, 13, 9
Cluster 3 (Upper right): 3, 8, 15
Cluster 4 (Right middle-lower): 1, 6, 12
Cluster 5 (Center-lower): 4, 11, 14

Cluster 1: 7, 2, 10
Cluster 2: 5, 13, 9
Cluster 3: 3, 8, 15
Cluster 4: 1, 6, 12
Cluster 5: 4, 11, 14
