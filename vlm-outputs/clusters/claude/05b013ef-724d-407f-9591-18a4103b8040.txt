I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 23, 1: Upper left area
- Points 11, 17: Left side, middle-upper
- Points 6, 24, 2: Left side, lower area
- Point 15: Center-left, upper-middle
- Points 18, 13, 7, 9: Center area, middle-lower
- Points 21, 4, 5: Center-right, upper area
- Point 3: Center-right, middle
- Points 16, 10, 14: Upper right area
- Points 22, 19, 8, 20: Right side, middle-lower
- Points 12, 25: Center-right, lower-middle

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 1, 23, 11, 17, 6, 24, 2, 15 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Center cluster:** Points 18, 13, 7, 9 - these form a group in the center-lower area

**Center-right/upper cluster:** Points 21, 4, 5, 3 - these are in the center-right middle area

**Right-upper cluster:** Points 16, 10, 14 - these are in the upper right corner

**Right-lower cluster:** Points 22, 19, 8, 20, 12, 25 - these are in the right side, lower-middle area

Cluster 1: 1, 23, 11, 17, 6, 24, 2, 15
Cluster 2: 18, 13, 7, 9
Cluster 3: 21, 4, 5, 3
Cluster 4: 16, 10, 14
Cluster 5: 22, 19, 8, 20, 12, 25
