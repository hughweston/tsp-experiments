I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: upper right area
- Point 2: upper left area
- Point 3: middle right area
- Point 4: right side, upper
- Point 5: lower middle area
- Point 6: upper left-center area
- Point 7: left side, middle
- Point 8: lower middle area
- Point 9: middle right area
- Point 10: upper center area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper left region:** Points 2, 6, 10 are relatively close together in the upper-left to upper-center area.

**Right side region:** Points 1, 4 are close together in the upper right. Points 3, 9 are very close together in the middle right area.

**Lower middle region:** Points 5, 8 are relatively close together in the lower portion.

**Left side:** Point 7 is isolated on the far left.

Let me reconsider to form coherent clusters:

- Points 2, 6, 10: upper left cluster
- Points 1, 4: upper right cluster
- Points 3, 9: middle right cluster (these are very close)
- Points 5, 8: lower middle cluster
- Point 7: isolated left side

I can combine some of these for cleaner groupings:

Cluster 1: 2, 6, 10 (upper left/center region)
Cluster 2: 1, 4, 3, 9 (right side of image)
Cluster 3: 7 (far left, isolated)
Cluster 4: 5, 8 (lower middle region)

Or more simply:

Cluster 1: 2, 6, 10, 7 (left side)
Cluster 2: 1, 4, 3, 9 (right side)
Cluster 3: 5, 8 (bottom center)

**Final Answer:**

Cluster 1: 2, 6, 7, 10
Cluster 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
Cluster 3: 5, 8
