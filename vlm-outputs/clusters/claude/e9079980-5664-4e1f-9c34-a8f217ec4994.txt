I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them by proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 18: top-left area
- Point 19: top-center area
- Point 1: left side, middle height
- Point 4, 5: center-left, upper-middle area
- Point 6: center, upper-middle area
- Point 16: right-center, upper area
- Point 10, 14: right-center, upper-middle area
- Point 2, 17: far right side
- Point 9: center, middle area
- Point 7: left side, lower-middle
- Point 8: left side, lower area
- Point 13: center-left, lower area
- Point 3, 15, 12: right-center, lower-middle area
- Point 11, 20: center-right, bottom area

Now let me group by spatial proximity:

**Top-left region:** Points 18, 19 (both at the top)

**Left-middle region:** Points 1, 7, 8 (forming a vertical cluster on the left)

**Center region:** Points 4, 5, 6, 9, 13 (central diagonal grouping)

**Upper-right region:** Points 16, 10, 14 (clustered together in upper right)

**Right side:** Points 2, 17 (far right, close together)

**Lower-right region:** Points 3, 15, 12, 11, 20 (bottom right cluster)

Let me consolidate into clearer clusters:

Cluster 1: 18, 19 (top area)
Cluster 2: 1, 7, 8 (left side)
Cluster 3: 4, 5, 6, 9, 13 (center diagonal)
Cluster 4: 10, 14, 16 (upper right)
Cluster 5: 2, 17 (far right)
Cluster 6: 3, 11, 12, 15, 20 (lower right)

Cluster 1: 18, 19
Cluster 2: 1, 7, 8
Cluster 3: 4, 5, 6, 9, 13
Cluster 4: 10, 14, 16
Cluster 5: 2, 17
Cluster 6: 3, 11, 12, 15, 20
