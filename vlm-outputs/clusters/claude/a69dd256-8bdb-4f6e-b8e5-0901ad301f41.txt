I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 1, 10, 19: Upper left area
- Points 4, 20: Left side, middle-lower
- Point 5: Far left, middle
- Points 3, 8, 13: Center-left, lower middle
- Point 14: Center, lower
- Points 6, 15: Upper center-left
- Points 7, 18: Upper center
- Point 2: Upper right
- Point 12: Right side, upper-middle
- Points 9, 11, 16, 17: Right side, lower-middle

Looking at the spatial distribution, I can identify these natural clusters:

**Upper left region:** Points 1, 10, 19 are close together

**Left-middle region:** Points 4, 5, 20 are near each other

**Center-left lower region:** Points 3, 8, 13, 14 form a group

**Upper center/right region:** Points 6, 15, 7, 18, 2 form a diagonal group in the upper portion

**Right side middle-lower:** Points 12, 9, 11, 16, 17 are clustered on the right side

Cluster 1: 1, 10, 19
Cluster 2: 4, 5, 20
Cluster 3: 3, 8, 13, 14
Cluster 4: 2, 6, 7, 15, 18
Cluster 5: 9, 11, 12, 16, 17
