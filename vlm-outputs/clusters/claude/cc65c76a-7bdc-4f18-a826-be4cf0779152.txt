I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 1: far right, upper-middle area
- Point 2: left-center area
- Point 3: far left, bottom area
- Point 4: center-left, lower area
- Point 5: upper area, center-left
- Point 6: far right, middle-lower area
- Point 7: upper area, center-right
- Point 8: left side, lower area
- Point 9: center, lower area
- Point 10: upper-left area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 5, 7, and 10 are all in the upper portion of the image, relatively close together.

**Lower-left cluster:** Points 3, 8, 2, and 4 are grouped in the lower-left region of the image.

**Right side cluster:** Points 1 and 6 are on the right side of the image.

**Lower-center:** Point 9 is in the lower-center area, closer to the lower-left group.

Let me refine:
- Points 5, 7, 10 are in the top area
- Points 3, 8, 2, 4, 9 form a cluster in the lower-left to center area
- Points 1, 6 are isolated on the right side

Cluster 1: 5, 7, 10
Cluster 2: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
Cluster 3: 1, 6
