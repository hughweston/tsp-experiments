I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

**Upper left area:** 7, 27, 8, 19
**Upper middle-right area:** 30, 11, 4, 22, 21, 20, 2, 5
**Left side (middle):** 15, 16, 24, 25, 18, 26
**Lower left area:** 28, 1
**Center-bottom area:** 12, 6, 13, 14
**Right side (middle-lower):** 9, 3, 17, 23, 10, 29

Let me refine these clusters based on visual proximity:

**Top region (upper portion of image):** 7, 27, 8, 19, 30, 11, 4, 22, 21, 20, 2, 5

**Left side cluster:** 15, 16, 24, 25, 18, 26, 28, 1

**Center-bottom cluster:** 12, 6, 13, 14

**Right side cluster:** 9, 3, 17, 23, 10, 29

Looking more carefully at the spatial distribution:

- Points 7, 27, 8, 19 are in the upper left
- Points 30, 11, 4, 22, 21, 20, 2, 5 form a diagonal line on the upper right
- Points 15, 16, 24, 25, 18, 26 are clustered on the left middle
- Points 28, 1 are on the lower left
- Points 12, 6, 13, 14 are in the center-bottom
- Points 9, 3, 17, 23, 10, 29 are on the right side

Cluster 1: 7, 27, 8, 19
Cluster 2: 30, 11, 4, 22, 21, 20, 2, 5
Cluster 3: 15, 16, 24, 25, 18, 26
Cluster 4: 1, 28, 12, 6, 13, 14
Cluster 5: 9, 3, 17, 23, 10, 29
