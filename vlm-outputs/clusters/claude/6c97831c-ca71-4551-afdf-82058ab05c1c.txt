I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 6: top center
- Point 15: upper left area
- Point 12: upper middle area
- Point 11: left side, upper-middle
- Point 5: left-center area
- Point 9: far right side
- Point 3: center
- Point 8: right-center area
- Point 13: center, below 3
- Point 10: center-right
- Point 4: center-left, lower
- Point 2: center, lower
- Point 14: center, lower
- Point 7: bottom left
- Point 1: bottom right

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 6, 12, 15 are grouped in the upper portion of the image.

**Left side cluster:** Points 11, 5, 7 are on the left side of the image.

**Central cluster:** Points 3, 13, 4, 2, 10, 14 form a dense group in the center-lower area.

**Right side cluster:** Points 8, 9, 1 are on the right side of the image.

Let me reconsider by looking at the actual distances more carefully:
- 6, 12, 15 are close together (upper area)
- 11 is somewhat isolated on the left
- 5 is left-center
- 3, 13, 10, 4, 2, 14 form a central dense cluster
- 8 is right-center, close to the central cluster
- 9 is far right, isolated
- 7 is bottom left, isolated
- 1 is bottom right

Grouping by closest proximity:

Cluster 1: 6, 12, 15 (upper region)
Cluster 2: 11, 5, 7 (left side)
Cluster 3: 3, 13, 10, 4, 2, 14, 8 (central region)
Cluster 4: 9, 1 (right side)

Cluster 1: 6, 12, 15
Cluster 2: 5, 7, 11
Cluster 3: 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14
Cluster 4: 1, 9
