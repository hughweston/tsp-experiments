I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top area: 18, 29, 24, 13, 1
- Upper-middle area: 4, 5, 9, 2, 14, 7, 27
- Middle area: 30, 23, 16, 26, 20, 11, 21
- Lower-middle area: 19, 8, 15, 25, 28, 17, 12
- Bottom area: 6, 3, 10, 22

Let me reconsider by looking at the actual spatial clustering:

**Left region:** 30, 19, 6, 4, 24, 8, 3

**Center region:** 18, 13, 5, 7, 23, 14, 16, 15, 25, 26, 10, 22

**Right region:** 29, 1, 9, 2, 27, 11, 20, 21, 17, 28, 12

Let me refine these clusters based on closer inspection:

**Upper left cluster:** 24, 4, 30, 19

**Lower left cluster:** 6, 3, 8

**Top center-right cluster:** 18, 13, 29, 1

**Middle center cluster:** 5, 7, 23, 14, 16, 15, 25, 26, 10

**Right cluster:** 9, 2, 27, 11, 20, 21, 17, 28, 12, 22

Let me simplify into clearer spatial groupings:

Cluster 1: 24, 18, 4, 30, 19 (left side, upper-middle left)

Cluster 2: 6, 3, 8 (lower left)

Cluster 3: 13, 5, 7, 23, 14, 16, 15, 25, 26, 10, 22 (center)

Cluster 4: 29, 1, 9, 2, 27, 11, 20, 21, 17, 28, 12 (right side)

Cluster 1: 24, 18, 4, 30, 19, 6, 3, 8
Cluster 2: 13, 5, 7, 23, 14, 16, 15, 25, 26, 10, 22
Cluster 3: 29, 1, 9, 2, 27, 11, 20, 21, 17, 28, 12
