I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on their proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Point 2: upper left area
- Point 9: upper middle-right area
- Point 6: middle-left area
- Point 19: middle-right area
- Point 8: center area
- Point 4: middle-right area
- Point 14: far right
- Point 17: right side
- Point 18: left-center area
- Point 16: left side
- Point 5: center
- Point 13: right side
- Point 11: far right
- Point 7: center-bottom
- Point 3: center-right bottom
- Point 15: right side
- Point 12: far left bottom
- Point 20: left-bottom area
- Point 10: center-bottom
- Point 1: center-bottom right

Now let me group by spatial proximity:

**Left cluster:** Points 2, 12, 16, 18, 20 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Center cluster:** Points 6, 8, 5, 7, 10 - these form a group in the central area

**Right cluster:** Points 9, 19, 4, 14, 17, 13, 11, 3, 15, 1 - these are on the right side of the image

Let me refine this based on closer inspection:

- Upper right area: 9, 19, 4, 14, 17
- Lower right area: 13, 11, 15, 3, 1
- Center area: 6, 8, 5, 7, 10
- Left area: 2, 16, 18, 12, 20

Cluster 1: 2, 12, 16, 18, 20
Cluster 2: 6, 8, 5, 7, 10
Cluster 3: 9, 19, 4, 14, 17, 13, 11, 15, 3, 1
