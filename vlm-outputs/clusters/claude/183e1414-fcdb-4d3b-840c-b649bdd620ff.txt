I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 2: upper left area
- Point 5: left side, middle height
- Point 6: left side, slightly below and right of 5
- Point 7: center-left, lower middle area
- Point 4: center, upper-middle area
- Point 3: center, middle area
- Point 9: right side, upper area
- Point 8: right side, middle-lower area
- Point 1: right side, lower area
- Point 10: bottom right corner

Looking at the spatial distribution, I can identify clusters:

**Left cluster:** Points 2, 5, 6, 7 - these are all on the left side of the image

**Center cluster:** Points 4, 3 - these are in the middle area of the image

**Right cluster:** Points 9, 8, 1, 10 - these are all on the right side of the image, forming a roughly vertical arrangement

Cluster 1: 2, 5, 6, 7
Cluster 2: 3, 4
Cluster 3: 1, 8, 9, 10
