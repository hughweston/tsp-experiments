I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Upper left area: 15, 23, 24, 1, 21
- Upper middle-right area: 25, 16, 18, 12
- Middle left area: 6, 7
- Middle area: 9, 11, 19, 4
- Right side: 8, 14, 22
- Lower left area: 10, 13, 20, 3
- Lower middle area: 5, 2
- Lower right area: 17

Let me refine these clusters by looking more carefully at spatial proximity:

**Top region (upper portion):**
- Far upper left: 15, 23, 24
- Upper middle: 1, 21, 9
- Upper right: 25, 16, 18, 12, 8, 14

**Middle region:**
- Middle left: 6, 7
- Center: 11, 19, 4
- Right: 22, 17

**Bottom region:**
- Lower left: 10, 13, 20, 3
- Lower middle: 5, 2

Let me create more coherent clusters:

**Cluster 1 (Upper left):** 15, 23, 24, 1, 21
**Cluster 2 (Upper right):** 25, 16, 18, 12, 8, 14
**Cluster 3 (Middle):** 6, 7, 9, 11, 19, 4, 22, 17
**Cluster 4 (Bottom):** 10, 13, 20, 3, 5, 2

Cluster 1: 15, 23, 24, 1, 21
Cluster 2: 25, 16, 18, 12, 8, 14
Cluster 3: 6, 7, 9, 11, 19, 4, 22, 17
Cluster 4: 10, 13, 20, 3, 5, 2
