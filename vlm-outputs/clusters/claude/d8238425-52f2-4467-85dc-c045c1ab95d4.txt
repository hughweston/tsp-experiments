I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top area: 19, 8 (upper left); 4, 17, 30, 23 (upper middle-right)
- Upper-middle area: 20, 18, 15, 24, 10, 25 (right side)
- Middle area: 14 (left); 28, 2, 6, 5 (center to right)
- Center area: 12, 3, 29, 21, 1 (middle band)
- Lower-middle: 16, 11 (left); 22, 27 (center); 26, 13 (right)
- Bottom area: 9 (left); 7 (center)

Let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Cluster 1 (Upper left):** Points 8, 19 - isolated in the upper left corner

**Cluster 2 (Upper right area):** Points 4, 17, 30, 23, 20, 18, 15, 24, 10, 25 - grouped in the upper right region

**Cluster 3 (Middle band):** Points 14, 28, 2, 12, 3, 29, 21, 1, 6, 5 - forms a middle horizontal band

**Cluster 4 (Lower area):** Points 16, 11, 22, 27, 7, 9, 26, 13 - grouped in the lower portion

Let me refine this based on closer examination:

Cluster 1: 8, 19 (upper left isolated)

Cluster 2: 4, 17, 30, 23, 20, 18, 15, 24, 10, 25, 6, 5 (upper right region)

Cluster 3: 14, 28, 2, 12, 3, 29, 21, 1 (middle section)

Cluster 4: 16, 11, 22, 27, 7, 9, 26, 13 (lower section)

Cluster 1: 8, 19
Cluster 2: 4, 17, 30, 23, 20, 18, 15, 24, 10, 25, 5, 6
Cluster 3: 14, 28, 2, 12, 3, 29, 21, 1
Cluster 4: 16, 11, 22, 27, 7, 9, 26, 13
