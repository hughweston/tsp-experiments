I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

**Upper left area:** 7, 21, 1, 29, 27, 28, 10, 6

**Upper middle area:** 25, 8, 13, 26, 30

**Upper right area:** 15, 19, 14, 2, 17, 24

**Lower middle area:** 18, 20, 5, 9, 11, 3, 4

**Lower right area:** 12, 22, 23, 16

Let me refine these clusters by looking more carefully at spatial proximity:

**Left side cluster (points on the left portion):**
- 7, 21, 1, 29, 27, 28, 10, 6

**Center cluster (middle area):**
- 25, 8, 13, 18, 20, 5, 9, 11, 3, 4

**Upper right cluster:**
- 26, 15, 19, 30, 14, 2, 17, 24

**Lower right cluster:**
- 12, 22, 23, 16

Let me reconsider and create more coherent groupings:

**Cluster 1 (Left side):** 7, 21, 1, 29, 27, 28, 10, 6

**Cluster 2 (Center):** 25, 8, 13, 18, 20, 5, 9, 11, 3, 4

**Cluster 3 (Right side - upper):** 26, 15, 19, 30, 14, 2, 17, 24

**Cluster 4 (Right side - lower):** 12, 22, 23, 16

Cluster 1: 7, 21, 1, 29, 27, 28, 10, 6
Cluster 2: 25, 8, 13, 18, 20, 5, 9, 11, 3, 4
Cluster 3: 26, 15, 19, 30, 14, 2, 17, 24
Cluster 4: 12, 16, 22, 23
