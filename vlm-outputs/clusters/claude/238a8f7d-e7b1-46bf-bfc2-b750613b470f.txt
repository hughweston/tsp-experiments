I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 6: upper left area
- Point 4: upper right area
- Point 8: upper right area (below 4)
- Point 1: center area
- Point 2: center-right area
- Point 7: right side, middle
- Point 3: left-center area
- Point 5: center-lower area
- Point 9: right side, lower-middle
- Point 10: lower left area

Now let me group them by spatial proximity:

**Upper right cluster:** Points 4, 8, 2, 7 are relatively close together in the right portion of the image, with 4 and 8 at the top right, and 2 and 7 slightly below them.

**Center/Left cluster:** Points 6, 3, 1, 10 - Point 6 is in the upper left, Point 3 is in the left-center, Point 1 is in the center, and Point 10 is in the lower left. These form a loose grouping on the left side.

**Lower right cluster:** Points 5 and 9 are both in the lower portion of the image, with 5 center-lower and 9 to its right.

Let me reconsider the groupings based on clearer proximity:

- Points 4, 8, 2, 7 cluster together on the right side
- Points 5, 9 are close together in the lower-middle to lower-right
- Points 6, 3, 10, 1 are more spread on the left/center-left

Cluster 1: 4, 8, 2, 7
Cluster 2: 5, 9
Cluster 3: 6, 3, 1, 10
