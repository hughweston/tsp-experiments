I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 6, 8, 9: Upper left area
- Point 1: Left side, middle-upper
- Point 10: Far left, middle
- Point 3: Lower left area
- Points 11, 14: Lower middle area
- Points 12, 16, 18: Center-upper area
- Points 17, 15, 7: Center area
- Points 5, 13, 20: Right side, upper-middle
- Points 4, 19: Right side, middle
- Point 2: Right side, lower

Now let me group by spatial proximity:

**Upper left cluster:** Points 6, 8, 9 are close together in the upper left corner, with point 1 nearby below them.

**Left-middle/lower cluster:** Points 10, 3, 11 are on the left-middle to lower-left area.

**Center cluster:** Points 12, 16, 18, 17, 15, 7, 14 form a central grouping.

**Right cluster:** Points 5, 13, 20, 4, 19, 2 are grouped on the right side.

Let me refine this:

Cluster 1 (Upper left): 6, 8, 9, 1
Cluster 2 (Left side): 10, 3
Cluster 3 (Center): 12, 16, 18, 17, 15, 7, 11, 14
Cluster 4 (Right side): 5, 13, 20, 4, 19, 2

**Final Answer:**

Cluster 1: 6, 8, 9, 1
Cluster 2: 10, 3
Cluster 3: 12, 16, 18, 17, 15, 7, 11, 14
Cluster 4: 5, 13, 20, 4, 19, 2
