I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top left area: 25, 5
- Top middle-right area: 22, 4, 10, 16, 23, 8
- Middle left area: 15, 1, 14, 24
- Middle center area: 18, 2, 13, 17
- Middle right area: 21, 19, 7, 11, 9
- Bottom area: 20, 12, 6, 3

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Upper left corner:** Points 25, 5 are isolated in the top-left

**Upper middle-right region:** Points 22, 4, 10, 16, 23, 8 form a group in the upper portion

**Middle-left region:** Points 15, 1, 14, 24 are clustered on the left side

**Center region:** Points 18, 2, 13, 17 are in the middle

**Right side region:** Points 21, 19, 7, 11, 9 form a group on the right

**Bottom region:** Points 20, 12, 6, 3 are in the lower portion

Let me consolidate into fewer, more meaningful clusters:

Cluster 1: 25, 5 (top-left isolated)

Cluster 2: 22, 4, 10, 16, 23, 8 (upper region)

Cluster 3: 15, 1, 14, 24, 18, 13, 2, 17 (middle-left to center)

Cluster 4: 21, 19, 7, 11, 9 (right side)

Cluster 5: 20, 12, 6, 3 (bottom region)

Cluster 1: 25, 5
Cluster 2: 22, 4, 10, 16, 23, 8
Cluster 3: 15, 1, 14, 24, 18, 13, 17, 2
Cluster 4: 7, 11, 9, 21, 19
Cluster 5: 20, 12, 6, 3
