I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Upper left area: 15
- Upper middle-right area: 18, 19, 3
- Upper right area: 21, 7, 5
- Middle-upper area: 4, 10, 22
- Middle-right area: 9
- Middle area: 14, 25
- Center-lower area: 2, 12, 24, 8, 13
- Lower-left area: 6, 16
- Right-center area: 1, 20, 23
- Lower-right area: 11, 17

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Top-right cluster**: Points 19, 3, 21, 7, 5 are clustered in the upper right portion

**Upper-middle cluster**: Points 18, 22, 10, 4 are in the upper-middle area

**Middle-right cluster**: Points 9, 1, 20, 23, 11, 17 form a vertical grouping on the right side

**Left-side cluster**: Points 15, 14, 25 are on the left side

**Center-bottom cluster**: Points 2, 12, 24, 8, 13 are grouped in the center-lower area

**Lower-left cluster**: Points 6, 16 are in the lower left

Let me refine this into cleaner clusters:

Cluster 1: 15, 14, 25, 6, 16 (left side vertical grouping)

Cluster 2: 4, 10, 18, 22 (upper middle area)

Cluster 3: 19, 3, 21, 7, 5, 9 (upper right area)

Cluster 4: 2, 12, 24, 8, 13 (center cluster)

Cluster 5: 1, 20, 23, 11, 17 (right-center to lower right)

Cluster 1: 15, 14, 25, 6, 16
Cluster 2: 4, 10, 18, 22
Cluster 3: 19, 3, 21, 7, 5, 9
Cluster 4: 2, 12, 24, 8, 13
Cluster 5: 1, 20, 23, 11, 17
