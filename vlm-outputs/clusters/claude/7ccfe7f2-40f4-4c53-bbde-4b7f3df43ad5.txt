I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:
- Point 8: upper right area
- Point 12: upper left area
- Point 4: upper middle area
- Point 14: upper middle-right area
- Point 5: middle area
- Point 11: middle area (near 5)
- Point 15: left side, middle height
- Point 1: center of image
- Point 13: right side, middle-lower
- Point 3: left side, lower-middle
- Point 6: far left, lower area
- Point 9: left side, lower area
- Point 7: lower middle-left
- Point 10: lower right area
- Point 2: far right, lower area

Now let me identify clusters based on spatial proximity:

**Upper region cluster:** Points 12, 4, 14, 8, 5, 11 - these are in the upper portion of the image

**Left side cluster:** Points 15, 3, 6, 9 - these form a group on the left side

**Lower/right cluster:** Points 1, 7, 10, 13, 2 - these are in the lower and right portions

Let me refine this:
- Points 4, 5, 11, 12, 14 are close together in the upper-middle area
- Point 8 is isolated in the upper right
- Points 6, 9, 3, 15 are on the left side
- Points 7, 10, 2, 13, 1 are in the lower/center-right area

Cluster 1: 4, 5, 11, 12, 14
Cluster 2: 6, 9, 3, 15
Cluster 3: 1, 7, 10, 13, 2
Cluster 4: 8
