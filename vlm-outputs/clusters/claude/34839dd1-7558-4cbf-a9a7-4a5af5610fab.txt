I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Top area: 4, 2, 20, 8, 6
- Upper right: 10
- Middle left: 11, 15, 5, 23, 24
- Middle center: 22, 3, 13
- Middle right: 14, 25, 17, 9
- Lower middle: 18, 12, 1, 16, 21
- Lower left: 7, 19

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Left side cluster:** Points 5, 11, 15, 23, 24, 7, 19 - these are all on the left portion of the image

**Top/upper-middle cluster:** Points 2, 4, 20, 6, 8 - these are in the upper portion

**Center cluster:** Points 22, 3, 13, 9, 12, 18 - these form a diagonal group in the middle

**Right side cluster:** Points 10, 14, 25, 17, 21 - these are on the right side

**Bottom center:** Points 1, 16 - these are at the bottom middle

Let me refine this into cleaner clusters:

Cluster 1: 2, 4, 20, 6, 8 (top region)

Cluster 2: 5, 11, 15, 23, 24, 7, 19 (left region)

Cluster 3: 22, 3, 13, 9, 12, 18, 1, 16 (center diagonal)

Cluster 4: 10, 14, 25, 17, 21 (right region)

**Cluster 1: 2, 4, 6, 8, 20**
**Cluster 2: 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 24**
**Cluster 3: 1, 3, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, 22**
**Cluster 4: 10, 14, 17, 21, 25**
