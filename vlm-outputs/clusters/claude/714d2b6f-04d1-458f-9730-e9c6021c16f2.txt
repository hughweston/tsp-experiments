I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them into clusters based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Left region: 11, 1, 6, 22 (far left side)
- Upper middle-left: 9, 13, 14, 25, 23, 16, 10, 2
- Lower middle: 7, 3, 4, 24, 15
- Right region: 5, 21, 17, 19, 12, 18, 8, 20

Let me refine these clusters by looking more carefully at the spatial groupings:

**Left cluster**: Points 11, 1, 6, 22 are clustered on the far left side

**Central cluster**: Points 9, 13, 14, 25, 23, 16, 10, 2, 3 form a group in the middle-upper area

**Lower-middle cluster**: Points 7, 4, 24, 15 are in the lower-middle region

**Right cluster**: Points 5, 21, 17, 19, 12, 18, 8, 20 are on the right side

Looking more carefully at the positions, I can see:
- Far left: 22, 6, 11, 1
- Center: 9, 13, 14, 25, 23, 16, 10, 2, 3
- Lower center: 7, 4, 24, 15
- Right side: 5, 21, 17, 19, 12, 18, 8, 20

Let me consolidate into clearer clusters:

Cluster 1: 22, 6, 11, 1 (far left)
Cluster 2: 9, 13, 14, 25, 23, 16, 10, 2, 3 (center-upper)
Cluster 3: 7, 4, 24, 15 (lower middle)
Cluster 4: 5, 21, 17, 19, 12, 18, 8, 20 (right side)

Cluster 1: 1, 6, 11, 22
Cluster 2: 2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 23, 25
Cluster 3: 4, 7, 15, 24
Cluster 4: 5, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
