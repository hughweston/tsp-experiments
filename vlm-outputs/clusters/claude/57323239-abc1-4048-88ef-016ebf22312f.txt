I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me identify the approximate positions of each point:

Upper left region: 26, 12, 17, 20
Upper middle-left: 14, 23, 15, 30
Upper right: 10, 9
Middle area: 8, 5, 1
Right side middle: 16, 22, 3, 13, 24, 25
Left side: 27
Lower middle-left: 29, 6, 18, 11
Lower middle: 4, 2, 19
Lower right: 21, 28, 7

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Top-left cluster:** Points 26, 12, 17, 20 are clustered in the upper left area

**Upper-middle cluster:** Points 14, 23, 15, 30 are in the upper-middle region

**Upper-right cluster:** Points 10, 9 are in the upper right corner

**Middle-left cluster:** Points 27, 1, 5, 8 are scattered in the left-center area

**Right side cluster:** Points 16, 22, 3, 13, 24, 25 form a group on the right side

**Lower-left cluster:** Points 29, 6, 18, 11 are in the lower-left area

**Lower-middle/right cluster:** Points 4, 2, 19, 21, 28, 7 are in the lower portion

Let me consolidate into clearer clusters:

Cluster 1: 26, 12, 17, 20 (upper left)
Cluster 2: 30, 14, 23, 15, 8 (upper middle)
Cluster 3: 10, 9 (upper right)
Cluster 4: 27, 1, 5 (left middle)
Cluster 5: 16, 22, 3, 13, 24, 25 (right side)
Cluster 6: 29, 6, 18, 11, 4, 2, 19, 21, 28, 7 (lower region)

Cluster 1: 26, 12, 17, 20
Cluster 2: 30, 14, 23, 15, 8
Cluster 3: 10, 9
Cluster 4: 27, 1, 5
Cluster 5: 16, 22, 3, 13, 24, 25
Cluster 6: 29, 6, 18, 11, 4, 2, 19, 21, 28, 7
