I need to analyze the spatial positions of the labeled points and group them based on proximity.

Let me first identify the approximate positions of each point:

- Points 17, 2, 9: Upper left area
- Points 10, 5, 19: Upper middle-left area
- Points 11, 4: Upper middle-right area
- Points 14, 20, 8: Right side, upper
- Points 13, 3: Middle right area
- Points 1, 7, 12: Center area
- Points 15, 6, 18: Lower right area
- Point 16: Lower left area (isolated)

Let me group these by spatial proximity:

**Upper left cluster:** Points 17, 2, 9, 10, 5, 19 - these are all in the upper left portion of the image

**Middle diagonal cluster:** Points 11, 4, 3, 13, 1, 7, 12 - these form a diagonal line through the middle

**Right side cluster:** Points 14, 20, 8, 6, 15, 18 - these are on the right side of the image

**Lower left:** Point 16 - isolated at bottom left, closest to the middle cluster or could join with upper left

Looking more carefully at distances:
- Point 16 is quite isolated at bottom left
- The upper left points (17, 2, 9, 10, 5, 19) form a group
- The middle points (11, 4, 1, 7, 12, 3, 13) form a diagonal
- The right side points (14, 20, 8, 6, 15, 18) form a vertical group

Point 16 appears closest to point 12/7 area, so I'll include it with the middle cluster.

Cluster 1: 17, 2, 9, 10, 5, 19
Cluster 2: 11, 4, 1, 7, 12, 3, 13, 16
Cluster 3: 14, 20, 8, 6, 15, 18
